00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.041
( Theme music playing )

2
00:01:53.114 --> 00:01:56.849
- Man: We're going to Braavos!
- ( seagulls screeching )

3
00:02:01.422 --> 00:02:05.624
In the old times, whenever
Braavos stood in danger,

4
00:02:05.626 --> 00:02:09.261
the Titan would step
with fire in his eyes.

5
00:02:09.263 --> 00:02:13.765
He'd wade into the sea
and smash the enemies.

6
00:02:14.368 --> 00:02:16.468
He's just a statue.

7
00:02:17.738 --> 00:02:20.139
( Horn blows )

8
00:02:20.141 --> 00:02:21.340
( laughs )

9
00:02:21.342 --> 00:02:22.741
Don't be afraid.

10
00:02:22.743 --> 00:02:25.744
He's announcing our arrival.

11
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.481
I'm not afraid.

12
00:02:45.232 --> 00:02:48.767
( People shouting )

13
00:03:13.394 --> 00:03:16.228
( sizzling )

14
00:03:36.917 --> 00:03:38.617
The House of Black and White.

15
00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:43.322
This is where you'll find
the man you seek.

16
00:03:47.962 --> 00:03:50.862
Here I leave you.

17
00:03:57.471 --> 00:03:58.870
Thank you for bringing me.

18
00:03:58.872 --> 00:04:02.708
Any man of Braavos
would have done the same.

19
00:04:04.378 --> 00:04:05.577
Valar morghulis.

20
00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.747
Valar dohaeris.

21
00:04:23.497 --> 00:04:25.797
( Knocks )

22
00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:33.038
( knocks )

23
00:04:43.317 --> 00:04:45.384
Hello.

24
00:04:47.855 --> 00:04:50.656
Valar morghulis.

25
00:04:55.062 --> 00:04:56.995
Um...

26
00:05:00.301 --> 00:05:03.435
Jaqen H'ghar gave me this.

27
00:05:06.073 --> 00:05:08.640
No one here by that name.

28
00:05:08.642 --> 00:05:10.075
Please.

29
00:05:10.077 --> 00:05:13.979
I crossed the Narrow Sea.
I have nowhere else to go.

30
00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:16.548
You have everywhere else to go.

31
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.483
But wait...

32
00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:20.852
( lock clanks )

33
00:05:38.372 --> 00:05:40.505
Cersei.

34
00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:43.041
Walder Frey.

35
00:05:43.043 --> 00:05:45.811
The Mountain.

36
00:05:45.813 --> 00:05:47.946
Meryn Trant.

37
00:05:48.982 --> 00:05:51.416
Cersei.

38
00:05:51.952 --> 00:05:54.953
Walder Frey.

39
00:05:54.955 --> 00:05:57.022
The Mountain.

40
00:05:58.125 --> 00:05:59.125
Meryn Trant.

41
00:05:59.126 --> 00:06:02.794
-  ( Thunder rumbling )
- Cersei. Walder Frey.

42
00:06:02.796 --> 00:06:05.430
The Mountain.

43
00:06:05.432 --> 00:06:07.366
Meryn Trant.

44
00:06:08.435 --> 00:06:10.035
Cersei.

45
00:06:10.037 --> 00:06:11.670
Walder Frey.

46
00:06:11.672 --> 00:06:13.372
The Mountain.

47
00:06:13.374 --> 00:06:15.807
Meryn Trant.

48
00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:18.377
Cersei.

49
00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:21.079
Walder Frey.

50
00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:23.448
The Mountain.

51
00:06:24.418 --> 00:06:26.651
Meryn Trant.

52
00:06:31.091 --> 00:06:34.526
( Sighs )

53
00:06:51.812 --> 00:06:54.746
( people chatting )

54
00:06:56.683 --> 00:06:59.751
Must be good food
if it's crowded.

55
00:07:04.091 --> 00:07:06.057
Ale?

56
00:07:12.833 --> 00:07:15.100
Ale?

57
00:07:21.041 --> 00:07:25.811
Before we left, a maester
gave you a raven scroll.

58
00:07:27.514 --> 00:07:29.848
You are becoming
an observant young lady.

59
00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.851
My mother used to say,
"Dark wings, dark words."

60
00:07:32.853 --> 00:07:37.489
An old saying.
Inaccurate in this case.

61
00:07:38.225 --> 00:07:39.758
Excuse me.

62
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.126
Sansa: So it was good news?

63
00:07:41.128 --> 00:07:42.994
My marriage proposal
has been accepted.

64
00:07:42.996 --> 00:07:47.065
I thought you still mourned the
death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.

65
00:07:47.067 --> 00:07:48.467
Ale?

66
00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:50.969
Sansa: I'll have some.

67
00:07:54.107 --> 00:07:56.141
My lady.

68
00:07:56.143 --> 00:07:57.108
What is it?

69
00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:00.545
Sansa Stark. Don't look.

70
00:08:00.547 --> 00:08:01.246
You sure?

71
00:08:01.248 --> 00:08:02.814
She's dyed her hair,
but it's her.

72
00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:05.083
She's sitting
with Petyr Baelish.

73
00:08:05.085 --> 00:08:05.984
Littlefinger?

74
00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:07.486
A bunch of knights with him.

75
00:08:07.488 --> 00:08:09.855
A bunch? What's a bunch, Podrick?
Six? 20?

76
00:08:09.857 --> 00:08:11.723
10, I think. Too many.

77
00:08:11.725 --> 00:08:13.158
My lady, I don't think
this is the right...

78
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.795
- Ready the horses.
- We only have one horse.

79
00:08:16.797 --> 00:08:18.897
Find more.

80
00:08:22.035 --> 00:08:24.169
( Door opens, closes )

81
00:08:24.171 --> 00:08:25.704
Do you like the taste?

82
00:08:25.706 --> 00:08:28.006
I don't see what
all the fuss is about.

83
00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:31.176
Why do men love it so much?

84
00:08:31.178 --> 00:08:33.245
It gives some men courage.

85
00:08:33.247 --> 00:08:36.648
Does it give you courage?

86
00:08:38.218 --> 00:08:40.852
Guard: That's far enough.

87
00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:44.122
Lord Baelish, Lady Sansa.

88
00:08:44.124 --> 00:08:46.091
My name is Brienne of Tarth.

89
00:08:46.093 --> 00:08:48.860
We've met with Renly Baratheon.

90
00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:51.730
What did he say about you?

91
00:08:51.732 --> 00:08:57.769
He said, "Your loyalty
came free of charge."

92
00:08:57.771 --> 00:09:01.606
Someone appears to have paid
quite a bit for it since then.

93
00:09:14.755 --> 00:09:17.155
Lady Sansa,

94
00:09:17.157 --> 00:09:19.190
before your mother's death,

95
00:09:19.192 --> 00:09:21.126
I was her sworn sword.

96
00:09:21.128 --> 00:09:24.329
I gave my word I would
find you and protect you.

97
00:09:24.331 --> 00:09:27.866
I will shield your back
and keep your counsel

98
00:09:27.868 --> 00:09:30.268
and give my life
for yours if need be.

99
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:35.040
I swear it by the old
gods and the new.

100
00:09:35.042 --> 00:09:36.942
Please, Lady Brienne,

101
00:09:36.944 --> 00:09:38.877
no need for such formality.

102
00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:41.713
You were Catelyn Stark's
sworn sword?

103
00:09:41.715 --> 00:09:43.315
- I was.
- Strange.

104
00:09:43.317 --> 00:09:45.617
I knew Cat from the time
we were children.

105
00:09:45.619 --> 00:09:46.952
She never mentioned you.

106
00:09:46.954 --> 00:09:49.321
It was after Renly's murder.

107
00:09:49.323 --> 00:09:50.188
Ah, yes.

108
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:51.756
You were accused of killing him.

109
00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:54.726
- I tried to save him.
- But you were accused.

110
00:09:54.728 --> 00:09:57.195
By men who didn't see
what happened.

111
00:09:57.197 --> 00:09:59.264
And what did happen?

112
00:10:03.003 --> 00:10:05.003
He was murdered by a shadow.

113
00:10:05.005 --> 00:10:08.673
A shadow with the face
of Stannis Baratheon.

114
00:10:08.675 --> 00:10:11.376
A shadow?

115
00:10:11.378 --> 00:10:15.714
With the face... ( scoffs )

116
00:10:15.716 --> 00:10:18.683
This woman swore
to protect Renly.

117
00:10:18.685 --> 00:10:19.351
She failed.

118
00:10:19.353 --> 00:10:22.053
She swore to protect your mother.
She failed.

119
00:10:22.055 --> 00:10:26.658
Why would I want somebody with your
history of failure guarding Lady Sansa?

120
00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.327
Why should you have
any say in her affairs?

121
00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:30.362
Because I am her uncle.

122
00:10:30.364 --> 00:10:34.165
I married her Aunt Lysa shortly
before my beloved's untimely death.

123
00:10:34.167 --> 00:10:36.368
We're family now
and you are an outsider.

124
00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:40.905
Forgive me, Lady Brienne, but experience
has made me wary of outsiders.

125
00:10:40.907 --> 00:10:44.976
Lady Sansa, if we can
have a word alone...

126
00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:45.710
No.

127
00:10:45.712 --> 00:10:47.178
Please, my lady.
If I could explain...

128
00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.981
I saw you at Joffrey's
wedding bowing to the king.

129
00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:53.718
Neither of us
wanted to be there.

130
00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.754
Sometimes we don't
have a choice.

131
00:10:55.756 --> 00:10:58.289
And sometimes we do.

132
00:10:58.959 --> 00:11:00.959
You should leave.

133
00:11:00.961 --> 00:11:04.396
We don't want our new friend
wandering the countryside alone.

134
00:11:04.398 --> 00:11:06.898
The roads in these parts
aren't safe.

135
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.300
Why don't you stay?

136
00:11:17.044 --> 00:11:19.010
The man asked you to stay...

137
00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:21.279
-  ( guards shouting )
- ( horses whinny )

138
00:11:21.281 --> 00:11:25.250
- ( horses neighing )
- Hyah! Hyah!

139
00:11:28.121 --> 00:11:30.121
( Grunts )

140
00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:33.191
Hyah! Hyah!

141
00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:37.162
- Guard: After her!
- ( men shouting )

142
00:11:47.174 --> 00:11:50.475
- Brienne: Yah! Hah!
- Podrick: Oh!

143
00:12:06.259 --> 00:12:10.028
- Podrick: Stop! Stop!
- Guard: I'll take him!

144
00:12:10.263 --> 00:12:12.797
- Podrick!
- ( screaming )

145
00:12:12.799 --> 00:12:15.767
Guard ♪2: Hold on to her!

146
00:12:18.171 --> 00:12:20.138
Take her!

147
00:12:35.155 --> 00:12:37.155
Guard ♪3: Keep moving!

148
00:12:37.157 --> 00:12:39.224
( shouting )

149
00:12:44.331 --> 00:12:46.965
( horse whinnies )

150
00:12:48.001 --> 00:12:52.003
( whimpering ) Stop! Stop! Stop!

151
00:12:52.005 --> 00:12:54.072
Stop! Stop!

152
00:12:54.374 --> 00:12:55.540
( Horse neighs )

153
00:12:55.542 --> 00:12:59.177
That's a good boy.
Come on. Come on.

154
00:13:00.413 --> 00:13:04.115
- ( Neighs )
- No, no, no, stop!

155
00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.393
( Hoofbeats )

156
00:13:15.395 --> 00:13:18.229
( horse neighs )

157
00:13:23.003 --> 00:13:25.170
I guess that means
you're unarmed.

158
00:13:25.172 --> 00:13:28.406
- Down, Podrick! Down!
- ( whimpering )

159
00:13:32.279 --> 00:13:35.413
( both shouting )

160
00:13:36.416 --> 00:13:39.317
( grunts )

161
00:13:46.893 --> 00:13:50.428
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lady?

162
00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:52.831
You can stand now.

163
00:13:52.833 --> 00:13:55.133
Yes, my lady.

164
00:13:57.571 --> 00:14:00.004
Sansa Stark?

165
00:14:00.006 --> 00:14:02.073
Wary of strangers,
as she should be.

166
00:14:02.075 --> 00:14:05.276
I saw her riding on the East
Road with Littlefinger.

167
00:14:05.278 --> 00:14:06.311
We'll follow them.

168
00:14:06.313 --> 00:14:10.615
My lady, if both Stark girls
refused your service,

169
00:14:10.617 --> 00:14:11.983
maybe you're released
from your vow.

170
00:14:11.985 --> 00:14:14.252
I swore to their mother
I would protect those girls.

171
00:14:14.254 --> 00:14:15.587
But if they don't want
your protection...

172
00:14:15.589 --> 00:14:18.957
Do you think she's safe
with Littlefinger?

173
00:14:20.927 --> 00:14:22.360
No, my lady.

174
00:14:22.362 --> 00:14:24.863
Get your horse.

175
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:33.271
- ( Door closes )
- ( footsteps )

176
00:14:33.273 --> 00:14:36.241
A summons from the queen.

177
00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:56.227
Cersei: There are only two
like it in the world.

178
00:14:56.229 --> 00:14:58.997
The one I'm wearing,
the one I gave to Myrcella.

179
00:14:58.999 --> 00:15:02.166
- It's a threat.
- Of course it's a threat.

180
00:15:02.168 --> 00:15:04.269
Our daughter's alone in Dorne

181
00:15:04.271 --> 00:15:08.473
surrounded by people
who hate our family.

182
00:15:08.475 --> 00:15:12.010
"It's a threat."

183
00:15:12.012 --> 00:15:12.510
No note?

184
00:15:12.512 --> 00:15:15.346
They blame us for the death
of Oberyn and his sister

185
00:15:15.348 --> 00:15:19.017
and every other tragedy that's
befallen their cursed country.

186
00:15:19.019 --> 00:15:22.020
I will burn their cities to
the ground if they touch her.

187
00:15:22.022 --> 00:15:23.588
- Softer.
- What?

188
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:24.590
Not so loud.

189
00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:27.625
Our daughter's in danger and you're
worried I'm speaking too loudly?

190
00:15:27.627 --> 00:15:31.362
The world can't know
she's our daughter.

191
00:15:31.364 --> 00:15:33.398
Then don't call her
your daughter.

192
00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.699
You've never been
a father to her.

193
00:15:34.701 --> 00:15:38.036
If I was a father to any of my children,
they'd be stoned in the street.

194
00:15:38.038 --> 00:15:41.239
And what has
your caution brought?

195
00:15:41.241 --> 00:15:44.442
Our eldest child murdered
at his own wedding.

196
00:15:44.444 --> 00:15:48.413
Our only daughter
shipped off to Dorne.

197
00:15:48.415 --> 00:15:49.681
Our baby boy set to marry

198
00:15:49.683 --> 00:15:53.618
that smirking whore
from Highgarden.

199
00:16:01.361 --> 00:16:02.727
I'm going to make things better.

200
00:16:02.729 --> 00:16:05.263
You've never made
anything better.

201
00:16:05.265 --> 00:16:06.197
I'm going to Dorne

202
00:16:06.199 --> 00:16:07.665
and I'm bringing
our daughter home.

203
00:16:07.667 --> 00:16:11.169
( Scoffs ) You can't
just ask Prince Doran

204
00:16:11.171 --> 00:16:13.137
to give her back.

205
00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:14.339
She's promised to his son.

206
00:16:14.341 --> 00:16:17.008
I'm not going
to ask him anything.

207
00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:20.044
You go down there with an
army, it's an act of war.

208
00:16:20.046 --> 00:16:21.079
No army.

209
00:16:21.081 --> 00:16:24.248
Do you know where
they're keeping her?

210
00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:29.120
Oberyn mentioned
the Water Gardens.

211
00:16:29.122 --> 00:16:31.389
I'll find her.

212
00:16:32.659 --> 00:16:35.994
Is there anything else,
Your Grace?

213
00:16:36.763 --> 00:16:41.032
( Chuckles )
You're going to Dorne?

214
00:16:41.034 --> 00:16:45.436
A one-handed man alone?

215
00:16:45.438 --> 00:16:48.339
I never said I was going alone.

216
00:16:54.547 --> 00:16:58.049
No sunflowers.
I don't like yellow.

217
00:16:58.051 --> 00:17:00.651
Roses are very nice.
Definitely roses.

218
00:17:00.653 --> 00:17:02.387
And music. I adore music.

219
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:04.055
But no flutes. I hate flutes.

220
00:17:04.057 --> 00:17:06.024
We can have a harp if you
like, but no flutes.

221
00:17:06.026 --> 00:17:08.393
Then there's the food. Food
is the most important thing.

222
00:17:08.395 --> 00:17:11.129
Don't you agree? We're
going to need pigeon pies.

223
00:17:11.131 --> 00:17:15.333
That's what they eat in
the capital, don't they?

224
00:17:15.335 --> 00:17:17.368
Don't they?

225
00:17:18.338 --> 00:17:19.170
Don't who?

226
00:17:19.172 --> 00:17:23.341
People eat pigeon
pie in the capital.

227
00:17:23.343 --> 00:17:25.443
They certainly do, my dear.

228
00:17:25.445 --> 00:17:27.612
They certainly do.

229
00:17:27.614 --> 00:17:30.348
It's a fine place, isn't it?

230
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:31.682
A fine place.

231
00:17:31.684 --> 00:17:33.584
I never thought I'd end up

232
00:17:33.586 --> 00:17:36.721
settling down
in a place like this.

233
00:17:36.723 --> 00:17:39.757
- You won't.
- Pardon?

234
00:17:39.759 --> 00:17:41.325
We won't get to live
at Stokeworth.

235
00:17:41.327 --> 00:17:44.762
When Mother dies, my sister gets
the castle because she's older.

236
00:17:44.764 --> 00:17:47.065
- Oh.
- She hates me.

237
00:17:47.067 --> 00:17:49.100
She calls me mean names
and sometimes even still

238
00:17:49.102 --> 00:17:53.237
she pulls my hair
when Mother's not looking.

239
00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.640
You know what I think?

240
00:17:55.642 --> 00:17:57.742
I think you're a good person.

241
00:17:57.744 --> 00:18:00.611
And your sister
is a mean person.

242
00:18:00.613 --> 00:18:02.513
She is.

243
00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:05.416
I've been all over the world,

244
00:18:05.418 --> 00:18:07.585
and if there's one thing
I've learned,

245
00:18:07.587 --> 00:18:10.822
it's that meanness comes around.

246
00:18:10.824 --> 00:18:12.323
People like your sister,

247
00:18:12.325 --> 00:18:16.294
they always get what's coming
to them eventually.

248
00:18:16.296 --> 00:18:18.796
One way or another.

249
00:18:21.568 --> 00:18:24.135
Who's that?

250
00:18:25.705 --> 00:18:29.107
Jaime fucking Lannister.

251
00:18:29.375 --> 00:18:33.511
- Ser Jaime.
- Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

252
00:18:33.513 --> 00:18:36.681
I was very sorry
to hear about your father.

253
00:18:36.683 --> 00:18:38.149
Thank you.

254
00:18:38.151 --> 00:18:41.819
This is my betrothed Lollys.

255
00:18:42.522 --> 00:18:45.156
A pleasure.

256
00:18:46.693 --> 00:18:49.293
Run along, love.

257
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.634
Beautiful young bride
you've chosen.

258
00:18:56.636 --> 00:18:58.636
When were you planning
on getting married?

259
00:18:58.638 --> 00:19:01.372
- Just get on with it.
- On with what?

260
00:19:01.374 --> 00:19:02.473
What you're here for.

261
00:19:02.475 --> 00:19:06.210
There's no way this little visit could
possibly mean anything good for me.

262
00:19:06.212 --> 00:19:08.880
It's very good for you.

263
00:19:19.559 --> 00:19:23.327
Lollys will be marrying
Ser Willis Bracken.

264
00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:24.195
Mmm.

265
00:19:24.197 --> 00:19:26.297
We made a deal,
your sister and I.

266
00:19:26.299 --> 00:19:28.699
- I would have advised against that.
- How is this good for me?

267
00:19:28.701 --> 00:19:32.203
'Cause you're going to come with me
and help me with something important.

268
00:19:32.205 --> 00:19:36.407
And when we return, I'm going
to give you a much better girl

269
00:19:36.409 --> 00:19:38.843
and a much better castle.

270
00:19:41.281 --> 00:19:43.414
Return from where?

271
00:19:43.416 --> 00:19:46.484
As far south as south goes.

272
00:19:58.898 --> 00:20:02.833
Trystane: My future queen.

273
00:20:02.835 --> 00:20:06.204
( speaking softly )

274
00:20:20.353 --> 00:20:22.787
The prince does not wish
to be disturbed.

275
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:24.522
Remove yourself from my path

276
00:20:24.524 --> 00:20:26.991
or I'll take that longaxe
and I'll shove it...

277
00:20:26.993 --> 00:20:29.594
Doran: Captain.

278
00:20:29.596 --> 00:20:32.330
Let her pass.

279
00:20:34.767 --> 00:20:37.568
Your brother was murdered

280
00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.737
and you sit here
in the Water Gardens

281
00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:41.672
staring at the sky
and doing nothing.

282
00:20:41.674 --> 00:20:44.942
Oberyn was slain
during a trial by combat.

283
00:20:44.944 --> 00:20:46.277
By law, that is not murder.

284
00:20:46.279 --> 00:20:48.579
- Your brother.
- You don't have to remind me.

285
00:20:48.581 --> 00:20:51.849
He was my brother long before
he was anything to you.

286
00:20:51.851 --> 00:20:53.718
What will you do
about his death?

287
00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:56.354
I will bury him.
I will mourn for him.

288
00:20:56.356 --> 00:20:58.923
- And then?
- You would have me go to war?

289
00:20:58.925 --> 00:21:00.524
The whole country
would have you go to war.

290
00:21:00.526 --> 00:21:04.895
Then we are lucky the whole
country does not decide.

291
00:21:05.898 --> 00:21:07.765
The Sand Snakes are with me.

292
00:21:07.767 --> 00:21:09.267
They have the love
of their people.

293
00:21:09.269 --> 00:21:12.303
They will avenge their
father while you sit here

294
00:21:12.305 --> 00:21:16.307
in your chair doing nothing.

295
00:21:19.312 --> 00:21:20.044
Oberyn is dead

296
00:21:20.046 --> 00:21:24.515
and this Lannister girl skips
about the Water Gardens

297
00:21:24.517 --> 00:21:28.019
eating our food,
breathing our air.

298
00:21:28.021 --> 00:21:32.490
How many of your brothers and
sisters do they have to kill?

299
00:21:33.426 --> 00:21:35.660
Let me have her.

300
00:21:35.995 --> 00:21:41.032
Let me send her to Cersei
one finger at a time.

301
00:21:42.035 --> 00:21:44.302
I loved my brother.

302
00:21:44.304 --> 00:21:45.836
And you made him very happy.

303
00:21:45.838 --> 00:21:49.907
For that, you will always
have a place in my heart.

304
00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:54.612
But we do not mutilate
little girls for vengeance.

305
00:21:54.614 --> 00:21:56.781
Not here.

306
00:21:56.783 --> 00:21:58.983
Not while I rule.

307
00:21:59.752 --> 00:22:02.620
And how long will that be?

308
00:22:17.503 --> 00:22:19.770
Daario: The Unsullied
are too conspicuous.

309
00:22:19.772 --> 00:22:22.673
Anyone can see you coming
from a mile off.

310
00:22:22.675 --> 00:22:25.543
Of course you haven't found
any Sons of the Harpy.

311
00:22:25.545 --> 00:22:27.845
You haven't, have you?

312
00:22:27.847 --> 00:22:28.713
( Grunts )

313
00:22:28.715 --> 00:22:32.083
My Second Sons,
on the other hand,

314
00:22:32.085 --> 00:22:35.553
they drink, they whore,

315
00:22:35.555 --> 00:22:37.555
fight in the streets,

316
00:22:37.557 --> 00:22:38.622
they blend in.

317
00:22:38.624 --> 00:22:40.524
They overhear things in taverns,

318
00:22:40.526 --> 00:22:44.862
follow people from the taverns
to nice, quiet alleys,

319
00:22:44.864 --> 00:22:46.964
break a few fingers,

320
00:22:46.966 --> 00:22:49.667
overhear a few more things.

321
00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:52.970
Before you know it...

322
00:23:11.724 --> 00:23:14.392
No one here.

323
00:23:14.394 --> 00:23:15.459
We go.

324
00:23:15.461 --> 00:23:18.429
In a hurry? You're afraid?

325
00:23:18.431 --> 00:23:20.765
Unsullied fear nothing.

326
00:23:20.767 --> 00:23:22.566
Right.

327
00:23:22.568 --> 00:23:23.934
That's your problem.

328
00:23:23.936 --> 00:23:26.404
You understood fear
once long ago,

329
00:23:26.406 --> 00:23:28.139
but you've forgotten
what it means.

330
00:23:28.141 --> 00:23:32.042
Someone who's forgotten fear

331
00:23:32.044 --> 00:23:34.512
has forgotten how to hide.

332
00:23:36.115 --> 00:23:38.516
( Man screams )

333
00:23:38.518 --> 00:23:40.651
( grunts )

334
00:23:40.653 --> 00:23:42.420
( groans )

335
00:23:42.422 --> 00:23:45.656
Fear is useful that way.

336
00:23:46.959 --> 00:23:49.927
( Man groaning )

337
00:23:54.667 --> 00:23:57.535
( screaming )

338
00:24:08.181 --> 00:24:12.583
Sons of the Harpy, they want to
put a collar back on my neck.

339
00:24:12.585 --> 00:24:13.751
On all of our necks.

340
00:24:13.753 --> 00:24:15.986
Please, Your Grace,
you must kill him.

341
00:24:15.988 --> 00:24:17.021
It would send a message.

342
00:24:17.023 --> 00:24:19.590
I think you should exercise
restraint, Your Grace.

343
00:24:19.592 --> 00:24:22.726
- Why?
- For one thing, he may have valuable information.

344
00:24:22.728 --> 00:24:26.230
The Son of the Harpy has no
more valuable information.

345
00:24:26.232 --> 00:24:27.631
How do you know that?

346
00:24:27.633 --> 00:24:29.133
Because I questioned him.

347
00:24:29.135 --> 00:24:31.001
Hizdahr: And the
information you did get,

348
00:24:31.003 --> 00:24:32.570
- he is young and poor.
- He is born free.

349
00:24:32.572 --> 00:24:35.206
Why should he want to bring back slavery?
What did it do for him?

350
00:24:35.208 --> 00:24:36.674
Perhaps the only thing
that gave him pride

351
00:24:36.676 --> 00:24:39.210
was knowing that there was
someone lower than he was.

352
00:24:39.212 --> 00:24:40.611
They pay him.

353
00:24:40.613 --> 00:24:41.946
Great families
afraid to do a thing.

354
00:24:41.948 --> 00:24:43.113
They pay poor man
to do it for them.

355
00:24:43.115 --> 00:24:45.182
- And how do you know this?
- Mossador: Everyone know this.

356
00:24:45.184 --> 00:24:47.184
I don't know it and I'm the
head of a great family.

357
00:24:47.186 --> 00:24:50.187
Barristan: We do not know what
this man did or didn't do.

358
00:24:50.189 --> 00:24:54.525
Give him a trial at least.
A fair trial.

359
00:24:54.527 --> 00:24:55.960
Show all the citizens of Meereen

360
00:24:55.962 --> 00:24:58.629
that you're better than
those who would depose you.

361
00:24:58.631 --> 00:24:59.697
Teach them a better way.

362
00:24:59.699 --> 00:25:02.132
I do not know the place
from where Old Ser comes.

363
00:25:02.134 --> 00:25:06.136
Things maybe are
different there, I hope.

364
00:25:06.138 --> 00:25:07.805
But here in Meereen,

365
00:25:07.807 --> 00:25:10.908
before Daenerys Stormborn,
they own us.

366
00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:13.210
So we learn much about them

367
00:25:13.212 --> 00:25:15.613
or we do not live long.

368
00:25:15.615 --> 00:25:17.581
They teach me what they are.

369
00:25:17.583 --> 00:25:22.152
Mercy, fair trial...
These mean nothing to them.

370
00:25:22.154 --> 00:25:25.256
All they understand is blood.

371
00:25:29.061 --> 00:25:32.663
Daenerys: Thank you
all for your counsel.

372
00:25:39.839 --> 00:25:42.640
Your Grace, a word,
please, I beg you.

373
00:25:42.642 --> 00:25:45.109
- About what?
- About your father.

374
00:25:45.111 --> 00:25:47.278
- About the Mad King.
- The Mad King?

375
00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.280
You're here to remind me
of my enemies' lies?

376
00:25:49.282 --> 00:25:50.314
Consider me reminded.

377
00:25:50.316 --> 00:25:54.685
Your Grace, I served
in his Kingsguard.

378
00:25:54.687 --> 00:25:56.787
I was at his side
from the first.

379
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:59.924
Your enemies did not lie.

380
00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.160
Go on.

381
00:26:03.696 --> 00:26:06.564
When the people rose
in revolt against him,

382
00:26:06.566 --> 00:26:10.067
your father set their towns
and castles aflame.

383
00:26:10.069 --> 00:26:13.737
He murdered sons
in front of their fathers.

384
00:26:13.739 --> 00:26:16.040
He burned men alive
with wildfire

385
00:26:16.042 --> 00:26:18.876
and laughed as they screamed.

386
00:26:18.878 --> 00:26:22.012
And his efforts
to stamp out dissent

387
00:26:22.014 --> 00:26:27.351
led to rebellion that killed
every Targaryen except two.

388
00:26:27.353 --> 00:26:29.687
I'm not my father.

389
00:26:29.689 --> 00:26:32.156
No, Your Grace. Thank the gods.

390
00:26:32.158 --> 00:26:36.961
But the Mad King gave his enemies the
justice he thought they deserved.

391
00:26:36.963 --> 00:26:42.333
And each time, it made him
feel powerful and right.

392
00:26:42.335 --> 00:26:44.835
Until the very end.

393
00:26:48.641 --> 00:26:51.208
I will not have the Son
of the Harpy executed

394
00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:53.777
without a fair trial.

395
00:26:56.716 --> 00:26:58.716
Your Grace.

396
00:26:58.718 --> 00:27:01.885
- ( Neighing )
- ( bleating )

397
00:27:07.827 --> 00:27:09.393
There's a bug.

398
00:27:09.395 --> 00:27:10.361
Yes, best be careful.

399
00:27:10.363 --> 00:27:13.263
You might accidently
consume some solid food.

400
00:27:13.265 --> 00:27:15.265
When I agreed to come with you,

401
00:27:15.267 --> 00:27:19.269
did I misrepresent
my intentions?

402
00:27:22.141 --> 00:27:25.843
Besides, what else
is there for me to do

403
00:27:25.845 --> 00:27:27.277
inside this fucking box?

404
00:27:27.279 --> 00:27:29.980
- You don't like it?
- I want to take a walk.

405
00:27:29.982 --> 00:27:30.848
You can't.

406
00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:32.049
Cersei has offered a lordship

407
00:27:32.051 --> 00:27:34.652
to the man who brings
her your head.

408
00:27:34.654 --> 00:27:36.020
She ought to offer her cunt.

409
00:27:36.022 --> 00:27:38.022
Best part of her
for the best part of me.

410
00:27:38.024 --> 00:27:42.393
Well, I suppose a box is as good
a place for me as anywhere.

411
00:27:42.395 --> 00:27:45.996
Are we really going to spend
the entire road to Volantis

412
00:27:45.998 --> 00:27:48.232
talking about
the futility of everything?

413
00:27:48.234 --> 00:27:50.401
You're right. No point.

414
00:27:50.403 --> 00:27:52.069
The road to Volantis?

415
00:27:52.071 --> 00:27:55.739
You said we were going to Meereen.
What's in Volantis?

416
00:27:55.741 --> 00:27:56.741
The road to Meereen.

417
00:27:56.742 --> 00:28:00.844
And what do you hope to find at
the end of the road to Meereen?

418
00:28:00.846 --> 00:28:02.946
I told you. A ruler.

419
00:28:02.948 --> 00:28:04.815
We've already got a ruler.

420
00:28:04.817 --> 00:28:07.251
Everywhere has already
got a ruler.

421
00:28:07.253 --> 00:28:10.320
Every pile of shit
on the side of every road

422
00:28:10.322 --> 00:28:11.922
has someone's banner
hanging from it.

423
00:28:11.924 --> 00:28:16.360
You were quite good,
you know, at ruling.

424
00:28:16.362 --> 00:28:19.063
During your brief
tenure as Hand.

425
00:28:19.065 --> 00:28:21.331
I didn't rule. I was a servant.

426
00:28:21.333 --> 00:28:23.333
Still, a man of talent.

427
00:28:23.335 --> 00:28:24.702
Managed to kill a lot of people.

428
00:28:24.704 --> 00:28:30.040
Yes, but you showed great
promise in other areas as well.

429
00:28:32.111 --> 00:28:35.779
She wanted me
to leave King's Landing.

430
00:28:35.781 --> 00:28:37.881
She begged me.

431
00:28:37.883 --> 00:28:39.717
I wouldn't go.

432
00:28:39.719 --> 00:28:40.884
Why?

433
00:28:40.886 --> 00:28:42.920
'Cause I liked it.

434
00:28:42.922 --> 00:28:46.824
Power. Even as a servant.

435
00:28:46.826 --> 00:28:49.460
People follow leaders.

436
00:28:49.462 --> 00:28:51.895
And they will never follow us.

437
00:28:51.897 --> 00:28:53.897
They find us repulsive.

438
00:28:53.899 --> 00:28:55.065
I find us repulsive.

439
00:28:55.067 --> 00:28:56.200
And we find them repulsive,

440
00:28:56.202 --> 00:29:00.804
which is why we surround ourselves
with large, comfortable boxes

441
00:29:00.806 --> 00:29:02.873
to keep them away.

442
00:29:02.875 --> 00:29:04.742
And yet,

443
00:29:04.744 --> 00:29:06.043
no matter what we do,

444
00:29:06.045 --> 00:29:11.348
people like you and me are never
really satisfied inside the box.

445
00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:14.051
Not for long.

446
00:29:14.053 --> 00:29:15.886
You're right.

447
00:29:15.888 --> 00:29:18.021
- Let's go for a walk.
- No.

448
00:29:18.023 --> 00:29:21.191
How many dwarves
are there in the world?

449
00:29:21.193 --> 00:29:25.195
Is Cersei going
to kill them all?

450
00:29:26.465 --> 00:29:28.398
( Fly buzzing )

451
00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.833
Not him.

452
00:29:29.835 --> 00:29:31.535
Are you trying
to deceive your queen?

453
00:29:31.537 --> 00:29:34.271
Shall I throw them
in a cell, Your Grace?

454
00:29:34.273 --> 00:29:36.140
That won't be necessary,
Ser Meryn.

455
00:29:36.142 --> 00:29:39.176
I don't want to dissuade
the other hunters.

456
00:29:39.178 --> 00:29:40.210
Mistakes will be made.

457
00:29:40.212 --> 00:29:42.379
- Thank you, Your Grace, thank you.
- Your Grace, thank you.

458
00:29:42.381 --> 00:29:44.281
- Take the head.
- Pardon me, Your Grace.

459
00:29:44.283 --> 00:29:46.350
I would take it
if you don't mind.

460
00:29:46.352 --> 00:29:49.520
It could prove useful
for my work.

461
00:29:49.522 --> 00:29:51.488
Very good.

462
00:29:53.959 --> 00:29:56.994
Over there will be fine.

463
00:29:56.996 --> 00:30:00.030
You heard the man. Over there.

464
00:30:00.032 --> 00:30:02.466
( Door closes )

465
00:30:27.059 --> 00:30:29.226
You're the Hand of the King?

466
00:30:29.228 --> 00:30:30.194
No, Uncle.

467
00:30:30.196 --> 00:30:31.829
Clearly it would not
be appropriate

468
00:30:31.831 --> 00:30:33.530
for a woman to assume that role.

469
00:30:33.532 --> 00:30:36.066
I'm merely advising my son
until he comes of age

470
00:30:36.068 --> 00:30:37.301
and chooses a Hand for himself.

471
00:30:37.303 --> 00:30:41.038
Your Grace, I would be willing
to serve provisionally

472
00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.440
as the King's Hand until
he becomes old enough...

473
00:30:43.442 --> 00:30:44.942
You're a good man, Lord Tyrell,

474
00:30:44.944 --> 00:30:47.244
but I don't imagine
you'll have the time.

475
00:30:47.246 --> 00:30:49.179
In addition to being
Master of Ships,

476
00:30:49.181 --> 00:30:53.183
the king has appointed
you Master of Coin.

477
00:30:53.953 --> 00:30:54.885
Oh, Your Grace.

478
00:30:54.887 --> 00:30:56.386
He called your experience
and wisdom

479
00:30:56.388 --> 00:30:58.288
in financial matters
unparalleled.

480
00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:01.091
He said he would
be honored to have you

481
00:31:01.093 --> 00:31:03.126
represent the crown's
interests in the same.

482
00:31:03.128 --> 00:31:04.995
The honor is all mine,
Your Grace.

483
00:31:04.997 --> 00:31:08.131
Your Grace, in the past
on several occasions,

484
00:31:08.133 --> 00:31:10.868
a Grand Maester has served
as the King's Hand.

485
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:17.107
The king has named Qyburn
the new Master of Whisperers.

486
00:31:17.343 --> 00:31:20.244
Your Grace, him?
This... this man?

487
00:31:20.246 --> 00:31:23.947
This embarrassment
to the Citadel?

488
00:31:23.949 --> 00:31:27.117
Your Grace, what qualifications

489
00:31:27.119 --> 00:31:28.919
can he possibly have
for this post?

490
00:31:28.921 --> 00:31:31.521
The qualification
of loyalty, Grand Maester.

491
00:31:31.523 --> 00:31:34.024
That's far more
than the eunuch ever had.

492
00:31:34.026 --> 00:31:36.593
Far more than many ever have.

493
00:31:36.595 --> 00:31:39.062
I must say, I cannot see...

494
00:31:39.064 --> 00:31:41.431
Uncle Kevan, in light
of your position

495
00:31:41.433 --> 00:31:42.966
as commander
of the Lannister armies,

496
00:31:42.968 --> 00:31:46.970
it would please the king if you
would serve as his Master of War.

497
00:31:46.972 --> 00:31:50.374
No man living better
deserves the title.

498
00:31:50.376 --> 00:31:52.376
That is kind of you to say.

499
00:31:52.378 --> 00:31:54.645
I would like to hear it
from the king himself.

500
00:31:54.647 --> 00:31:56.146
The king is very busy
at this moment.

501
00:31:56.148 --> 00:31:59.416
He should be here learning
what it means to rule.

502
00:31:59.418 --> 00:32:00.350
He is learning.

503
00:32:00.352 --> 00:32:02.686
On this occasion,
in his capacity as ruler,

504
00:32:02.688 --> 00:32:04.588
he's asked me to speak
on his behalf.

505
00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:08.625
I returned to the capital to
pay my respects to my brother.

506
00:32:08.627 --> 00:32:12.195
And to you.
And to serve the king.

507
00:32:12.197 --> 00:32:14.398
I did not return to the capital

508
00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.432
to serve as your puppet.

509
00:32:15.434 --> 00:32:19.303
To watch you stack the small
council with sycophants.

510
00:32:19.305 --> 00:32:21.471
Sending your own brother
away so he wouldn't be...

511
00:32:21.473 --> 00:32:23.941
My brother has left
the capital to lead

512
00:32:23.943 --> 00:32:26.143
a sensitive diplomatic mission.

513
00:32:26.145 --> 00:32:26.677
What mission?

514
00:32:26.679 --> 00:32:30.614
That is not your concern
as Master of War.

515
00:32:31.283 --> 00:32:33.083
I do not recognize
your authority

516
00:32:33.085 --> 00:32:36.353
to dictate what is
and is not my concern.

517
00:32:36.355 --> 00:32:41.058
You are the Queen Mother,
nothing more.

518
00:32:43.329 --> 00:32:46.163
You would abandon your king
in his time of need?

519
00:32:46.165 --> 00:32:50.267
If he wants to send for me,
I will be waiting for him.

520
00:32:50.269 --> 00:32:52.970
At Casterly Rock.

521
00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:59.076
( Door closes )

522
00:32:59.078 --> 00:33:02.980
Shireen: Come on,
you know this one.

523
00:33:03.515 --> 00:33:06.183
It looks like an animal.

524
00:33:08.287 --> 00:33:10.187
Snake.

525
00:33:10.189 --> 00:33:12.222
Sssnake. S.

526
00:33:12.224 --> 00:33:15.359
- It's an S.
- Right, very good.

527
00:33:15.361 --> 00:33:16.361
Huh!

528
00:33:16.362 --> 00:33:19.129
Did you know that the youngest
Lord Commander in history

529
00:33:19.131 --> 00:33:22.466
Osric Stark was elected
at the age of 10?

530
00:33:24.003 --> 00:33:25.369
I know S.

531
00:33:25.371 --> 00:33:26.503
You'll learn, I promise.

532
00:33:26.505 --> 00:33:30.474
I taught Ser Davos, and old people
are terrible at learning new things.

533
00:33:30.476 --> 00:33:34.011
Well, you're
a wonderful teacher.

534
00:33:34.013 --> 00:33:34.711
Very patient.

535
00:33:34.713 --> 00:33:37.547
I only said that the more time
that you spend practicing,

536
00:33:37.549 --> 00:33:39.282
the faster
you'll be able to read.

537
00:33:39.284 --> 00:33:42.319
That's all right.
We're doing just fine.

538
00:33:42.321 --> 00:33:45.155
I'm sure you and "Ostrich" Stark

539
00:33:45.157 --> 00:33:48.325
have a lot to talk about.

540
00:33:49.261 --> 00:33:52.396
How old were you when you
learned how to read?

541
00:33:52.398 --> 00:33:53.730
- Three.
- Three?

542
00:33:53.732 --> 00:33:55.332
Who taught you, your mother?

543
00:33:55.334 --> 00:33:58.769
No, old Maester Cressen did.

544
00:33:58.771 --> 00:34:00.537
I had a lot of time to practice.

545
00:34:00.539 --> 00:34:03.673
My mother kept me
inside because...

546
00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:07.210
What do you call it
in the south,

547
00:34:07.212 --> 00:34:09.513
what happened to your face?

548
00:34:09.515 --> 00:34:10.747
Greyscale.

549
00:34:10.749 --> 00:34:14.284
What do you call it
north of the Wall?

550
00:34:14.286 --> 00:34:16.186
I don't know.

551
00:34:16.188 --> 00:34:18.188
But two of my sisters had it.

552
00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:19.656
They both died.

553
00:34:19.658 --> 00:34:21.358
How did they cure you?

554
00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.826
I don't remember.

555
00:34:22.828 --> 00:34:23.727
I was a baby.

556
00:34:23.729 --> 00:34:26.296
Lots of people came
and tried, I think.

557
00:34:26.298 --> 00:34:29.366
Whatever they did, it went away.

558
00:34:30.369 --> 00:34:32.736
What happened to your sisters?

559
00:34:33.338 --> 00:34:38.675
My father made them move out of
the keep into the huts outside.

560
00:34:38.677 --> 00:34:41.144
None of us were allowed
to go near them.

561
00:34:41.146 --> 00:34:45.415
But we heard them,
especially at night.

562
00:34:45.417 --> 00:34:50.120
They started to sound
not like themselves.

563
00:34:50.122 --> 00:34:53.356
Did you ever see them?

564
00:34:53.358 --> 00:34:56.326
Only once at the end.

565
00:34:56.862 --> 00:34:59.362
They were covered with it.

566
00:34:59.364 --> 00:35:03.433
Their faces, their arms.

567
00:35:03.435 --> 00:35:05.602
They acted like animals.

568
00:35:05.604 --> 00:35:09.506
My father had to drag them
out to the woods on a rope.

569
00:35:09.508 --> 00:35:12.776
What did he do with them
in the woods?

570
00:35:15.147 --> 00:35:17.280
( Footsteps )

571
00:35:17.282 --> 00:35:19.549
Mother.

572
00:35:19.551 --> 00:35:21.585
Leave us.

573
00:35:23.755 --> 00:35:25.555
Your Grace.

574
00:35:26.291 --> 00:35:28.225
You need to stay
away from that girl.

575
00:35:28.227 --> 00:35:29.693
- Why?
- She's a wildling.

576
00:35:29.695 --> 00:35:31.728
Her name is Gilly. She's nice.

577
00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:33.330
I'm teaching her to read.

578
00:35:33.332 --> 00:35:34.464
She's a wildling.

579
00:35:34.466 --> 00:35:36.199
Your father defeated her people.

580
00:35:36.201 --> 00:35:38.602
He executed their king
for treason.

581
00:35:38.604 --> 00:35:42.172
They could strike at him
by striking at you.

582
00:35:42.174 --> 00:35:44.808
Gilly wouldn't do that.

583
00:35:45.277 --> 00:35:48.211
You have no idea
what people will do.

584
00:35:48.213 --> 00:35:51.815
All your books
and you still don't know.

585
00:35:56.288 --> 00:35:58.722
Stannis: I ordered Mance
Rayder burned at the stake.

586
00:35:58.724 --> 00:36:01.758
You prevented that order
from being carried out.

587
00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:04.694
You showed mercy
to Mance Rayder.

588
00:36:04.696 --> 00:36:06.596
A king's word is law.

589
00:36:06.598 --> 00:36:09.432
Perhaps you should ask
Ser Davos how much mercy

590
00:36:09.434 --> 00:36:11.935
I show to lawbreakers.

591
00:36:14.506 --> 00:36:16.473
Show too much kindness,
people won't fear you.

592
00:36:16.475 --> 00:36:18.842
If they don't fear you,
they don't follow you.

593
00:36:18.844 --> 00:36:20.210
With respect, Your Grace,

594
00:36:20.212 --> 00:36:24.281
the free folk will never follow
you no matter what you do.

595
00:36:24.283 --> 00:36:26.783
You're the man who burned
their king alive.

596
00:36:26.785 --> 00:36:29.486
Who, then?

597
00:36:30.556 --> 00:36:31.821
You?

598
00:36:31.823 --> 00:36:33.523
No.

599
00:36:33.525 --> 00:36:36.293
Only one of their own.

600
00:36:37.229 --> 00:36:40.363
Do you know this wretched girl,

601
00:36:40.365 --> 00:36:41.531
Lyanna Mormont?

602
00:36:41.533 --> 00:36:42.866
The Lord Commander's niece.

603
00:36:42.868 --> 00:36:47.370
Lady of Bear Island
and a child of 10.

604
00:36:47.372 --> 00:36:50.774
I asked her to commit her house
to my cause. That's her response.

605
00:36:50.776 --> 00:36:54.644
"Bear Island knows no king
but the King in the North,

606
00:36:54.646 --> 00:36:57.314
whose name is Stark."

607
00:36:57.316 --> 00:36:59.549
That amuses you?

608
00:37:00.385 --> 00:37:02.819
I apologize, Your Grace.

609
00:37:02.821 --> 00:37:07.424
Northerners can be
a bit like the free folk.

610
00:37:07.426 --> 00:37:10.493
- Loyal to their own.
- Stannis: I know.

611
00:37:10.495 --> 00:37:12.662
My brother Robert
went on often and loudly

612
00:37:12.664 --> 00:37:16.533
about how difficult
it was to control them.

613
00:37:17.469 --> 00:37:20.570
Even with your father's help.

614
00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:26.276
Tonight, the Night's Watch
elect a new Lord Commander.

615
00:37:26.278 --> 00:37:28.311
Ser Alliser Thorne
is going to win.

616
00:37:28.313 --> 00:37:30.680
- Most likely.
- Unpleasant man.

617
00:37:30.682 --> 00:37:32.282
He thinks you're a traitor.

618
00:37:32.284 --> 00:37:36.419
What's your life going to be like here
at the Wall with Thorne in command?

619
00:37:36.421 --> 00:37:37.787
Unpleasant, I expect.

620
00:37:37.789 --> 00:37:41.258
Your bravery made him look weak.

621
00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:42.792
He'll punish you for it.

622
00:37:42.794 --> 00:37:44.928
I don't punish men for bravery.

623
00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:46.563
I reward them.

624
00:37:46.565 --> 00:37:49.399
I don't doubt it, Your Grace.

625
00:37:49.401 --> 00:37:51.334
But I'm a brother
of the Night's Watch.

626
00:37:51.336 --> 00:37:53.737
I pledged them my life,
my honor, my sword.

627
00:37:53.739 --> 00:37:56.339
I don't know what
I have left to give you.

628
00:37:56.341 --> 00:37:59.409
You can give me the North.

629
00:37:59.411 --> 00:38:01.878
I can't.

630
00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:05.782
Even if I wanted to,
I'm a bastard, a Snow.

631
00:38:05.784 --> 00:38:08.585
Kneel before me. Lay
your sword at my feet.

632
00:38:08.587 --> 00:38:12.722
Pledge me your service and
you'll rise again as Jon Stark,

633
00:38:12.724 --> 00:38:15.325
Lord of Winterfell.

634
00:38:19.031 --> 00:38:21.765
He'll make you a Stark
with the stroke of a pen?

635
00:38:21.767 --> 00:38:25.635
It's the first thing
I ever remember wanting.

636
00:38:25.637 --> 00:38:28.038
I'd daydream that my father
would ask the king

637
00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:31.975
and just like that, I would never
be the bastard of Winterfell again.

638
00:38:31.977 --> 00:38:34.444
You deserve this. You do.

639
00:38:34.446 --> 00:38:37.347
I couldn't be happier for you.

640
00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:40.317
I'm going to refuse him.

641
00:38:40.919 --> 00:38:44.821
But you'd be Lord of Winterfell.

642
00:38:44.823 --> 00:38:47.090
I swore a vow
to the Night's Watch.

643
00:38:47.092 --> 00:38:48.692
If I don't take
my own word seriously,

644
00:38:48.694 --> 00:38:52.462
what sort of Lord
of Winterfell would I be?

645
00:38:55.634 --> 00:39:00.470
Alliser: Crowded. You'd think
we were serving venison stew.

646
00:39:00.472 --> 00:39:02.405
( laughter )

647
00:39:02.407 --> 00:39:04.541
( groaning )

648
00:39:04.543 --> 00:39:06.443
( clears throat )

649
00:39:06.445 --> 00:39:11.481
Does anyone wish
to speak for candidates

650
00:39:11.483 --> 00:39:14.017
before we cast our tokens

651
00:39:14.019 --> 00:39:18.855
for the 998th Lord Commander

652
00:39:18.857 --> 00:39:20.890
of the Night's Watch?

653
00:39:22.361 --> 00:39:24.527
Ser Alliser Thorne
is not just a knight,

654
00:39:24.529 --> 00:39:25.862
he's a man of true nobility.

655
00:39:25.864 --> 00:39:28.598
He was acting commander when
the Wall came under attack

656
00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:31.601
- and led us to victory against the wildlings.
- Men: Hear, hear.

657
00:39:31.603 --> 00:39:32.869
Slynt: He's a veteran
of 100 battles

658
00:39:32.871 --> 00:39:37.540
and has been a defender of the Watch
and the Wall almost all of his life.

659
00:39:37.542 --> 00:39:38.775
Man: Aye.

660
00:39:38.777 --> 00:39:40.076
He's the only true choice.

661
00:39:40.078 --> 00:39:43.780
( Men cheering, pounding table )

662
00:39:43.782 --> 00:39:46.716
Ser Denys Mallister
joined the Watch as a boy

663
00:39:46.718 --> 00:39:50.720
and has served loyally
longer than any other ranger.

664
00:39:50.722 --> 00:39:53.857
Through 10 winters he served.

665
00:39:53.859 --> 00:39:55.558
As commander
of the Shadow Tower,

666
00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:57.093
he kept the wildlings away.

667
00:39:57.095 --> 00:39:58.728
We could do no better.

668
00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:02.599
( men cheering, pounding table )

669
00:40:03.001 --> 00:40:05.101
Aemon: If there is no one else,

670
00:40:05.103 --> 00:40:06.803
we will begin the voting.

671
00:40:06.805 --> 00:40:09.906
The triangular tokens count

672
00:40:09.908 --> 00:40:12.008
for Ser Alliser Thorne.

673
00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:16.045
The square tokens
for Ser Denys Mallister.

674
00:40:16.047 --> 00:40:20.049
-  Each brother will...
- Maester Aemon.

675
00:40:20.585 --> 00:40:23.853
Aemon: Samwell Tarly. Go on.

676
00:40:23.855 --> 00:40:26.923
- Slynt: Sam the Slayer.
- ( men laughing )

677
00:40:26.925 --> 00:40:30.527
Another wildling lover just
like his friend Jon Snow.

678
00:40:30.529 --> 00:40:32.128
How's your lady love, Slayer?

679
00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:34.964
- ( Men laughing )
- Her name is Gilly.

680
00:40:34.966 --> 00:40:36.533
Brother Slynt
knows her quite well.

681
00:40:36.535 --> 00:40:40.503
They cowered together in the larder
during the battle for the Wall.

682
00:40:40.505 --> 00:40:42.539
- ( Men laughing )
- Slynt: Lies!

683
00:40:42.541 --> 00:40:45.608
A wildling girl, a baby,

684
00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:46.610
and Lord Janos.

685
00:40:46.611 --> 00:40:49.712
I found him there
after the battle was over

686
00:40:49.714 --> 00:40:51.481
in a puddle of his own making.

687
00:40:51.483 --> 00:40:53.883
( Men laughing )

688
00:40:54.686 --> 00:40:57.887
Whilst Lord Janos was hiding

689
00:40:57.889 --> 00:41:00.757
with the women and children,

690
00:41:00.759 --> 00:41:02.859
Jon Snow was leading.

691
00:41:02.861 --> 00:41:04.961
Ser Alliser fought
bravely, it is true.

692
00:41:04.963 --> 00:41:07.997
And when he was wounded,
it was Jon who saved us.

693
00:41:07.999 --> 00:41:10.099
He took charge
of the Wall's defense.

694
00:41:10.101 --> 00:41:12.535
He killed the Magnar
of the Thenns.

695
00:41:12.537 --> 00:41:14.671
He went north to deal
with Mance Rayder

696
00:41:14.673 --> 00:41:18.908
knowing it almost certainly
meant his own death.

697
00:41:21.913 --> 00:41:23.813
Before that,

698
00:41:23.815 --> 00:41:28.218
he led the mission to avenge
Lord Commander Mormont.

699
00:41:28.753 --> 00:41:31.554
Mormont himself chose Jon
to be his steward.

700
00:41:31.556 --> 00:41:36.025
He saw something in Jon and
now we've all seen it, too.

701
00:41:36.027 --> 00:41:38.495
He may be young,

702
00:41:38.497 --> 00:41:40.897
but he's the commander
we turned to

703
00:41:40.899 --> 00:41:42.131
when the night was darkest.

704
00:41:42.133 --> 00:41:46.102
( Men cheering, pounding table )

705
00:41:49.908 --> 00:41:54.644
I can't argue with any of that.

706
00:41:54.646 --> 00:41:57.680
But who does Jon Snow
want to command?

707
00:41:57.682 --> 00:42:01.017
Night's Watch

708
00:42:01.019 --> 00:42:02.051
or the wildlings?

709
00:42:02.053 --> 00:42:05.889
Everyone knows he loved
a wildling girl

710
00:42:05.891 --> 00:42:07.524
and spoke with
Mance Rayder many times.

711
00:42:07.526 --> 00:42:11.895
What would have happened in that
tent between those two old friends

712
00:42:11.897 --> 00:42:13.696
if Stannis's army
hadn't come along?

713
00:42:13.698 --> 00:42:17.934
We all saw him put the
King-beyond-the-Wall out of his misery.

714
00:42:17.936 --> 00:42:22.972
Do you want to choose a man who has
fought the wildlings all his life

715
00:42:22.974 --> 00:42:26.109
or a man who makes love to them?

716
00:42:33.285 --> 00:42:35.618
It is time.

717
00:43:20.332 --> 00:43:24.734
It appears to be a tie, Maester.

718
00:43:41.353 --> 00:43:43.219
( Cheering )

719
00:43:43.221 --> 00:43:47.957
( men chanting ) Jon Snow! Jon Snow!
Jon Snow! Jon Snow!

720
00:43:47.959 --> 00:43:51.160
( Chanting continues )

721
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:06.376
( cooing )

722
00:44:17.288 --> 00:44:19.288
( laughing )

723
00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:22.792
You. You.

724
00:44:25.063 --> 00:44:28.164
What have you got there?

725
00:44:28.166 --> 00:44:29.132
( laughs )

726
00:44:29.134 --> 00:44:32.902
- I said...
- Turn around and go.

727
00:44:34.406 --> 00:44:37.440
Turn around and go.

728
00:44:37.442 --> 00:44:38.941
That's a nice little sword.

729
00:44:38.943 --> 00:44:42.178
Worth 100 pieces,
a sword like that.

730
00:44:43.114 --> 00:44:46.416
Nothing's worth
anything to dead men.

731
00:44:48.853 --> 00:44:50.453
Thug: Come on.

732
00:44:50.455 --> 00:44:52.755
Quickly, go! Go!

733
00:45:04.969 --> 00:45:06.836
Who are you?

734
00:45:06.838 --> 00:45:08.805
Why were they scared of you?

735
00:45:08.807 --> 00:45:11.240
You lost this.

736
00:45:21.186 --> 00:45:24.187
You said there was
no Jaqen H'ghar here.

737
00:45:24.189 --> 00:45:25.388
There isn't.

738
00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:28.858
A man is not Jaqen H'ghar.

739
00:45:30.195 --> 00:45:33.229
Well, who are you, then?

740
00:45:33.231 --> 00:45:34.430
No one.

741
00:45:34.432 --> 00:45:38.301
And that is who
a girl must become.

742
00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:28.785
( Speaking Valyrian )

743
00:46:48.907 --> 00:46:51.040
Daenerys: Why?

744
00:46:51.042 --> 00:46:54.310
( speaking Valyrian )

745
00:48:30.408 --> 00:48:33.409
( crowd shouting ) Mhysa! Mhysa!

746
00:48:33.411 --> 00:48:35.244
Mhysa! Mhysa!

747
00:48:35.246 --> 00:48:38.915
( Shouting continues )

748
00:48:54.966 --> 00:48:57.633
Mhysa! Mhysa!

749
00:48:57.635 --> 00:48:59.936
Mhysa!

750
00:48:59.938 --> 00:49:01.470
She should have cut off
the traitor's head

751
00:49:01.472 --> 00:49:03.239
in the Great Pyramid
and been done with it.

752
00:49:03.241 --> 00:49:06.642
Which is what I keep
telling her to do to you.

753
00:49:07.645 --> 00:49:12.348
( Shouting continues )
Mhysa! Mhysa!

754
00:49:13.051 --> 00:49:16.452
( Speaking Valyrian )

755
00:49:30.702 --> 00:49:34.370
( crowd murmuring )

756
00:50:21.285 --> 00:50:24.653
( crowd shouting )

757
00:50:31.129 --> 00:50:32.628
Mhysa.

758
00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:41.404
( Quietly speaking Valyrian )

759
00:50:41.406 --> 00:50:44.140
( crowd shouting )

760
00:51:06.364 --> 00:51:09.432
-  ( head thumps )
- ( woman echoes ) Mhysa!

761
00:51:09.434 --> 00:51:12.101
( Shouting stops )

762
00:51:14.238 --> 00:51:17.573
( hissing )

763
00:51:20.278 --> 00:51:22.645
( hissing continues )

764
00:51:26.717 --> 00:51:29.652
( crowd shouting )

765
00:51:29.654 --> 00:51:32.121
( groans )

766
00:52:08.593 --> 00:52:11.293
( bird screeching )

767
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:15.564
I'll stand guard outside your
door tonight, Your Grace.

768
00:52:15.566 --> 00:52:18.534
We all guard tonight.

769
00:52:18.536 --> 00:52:20.603
Leave me.

770
00:52:32.416 --> 00:52:35.551
( Soft thumping )

771
00:52:50.535 --> 00:52:53.269
( wind howling )

772
00:52:59.310 --> 00:53:02.945
( soft growling )

773
00:53:07.818 --> 00:53:10.686
( growls )

774
00:53:12.823 --> 00:53:15.291
Drogon.

775
00:53:58.769 --> 00:54:00.970
( Roars )

776
00:54:05.843 --> 00:54:10.012
( roaring )

777
00:54:12.817 --> 00:54:15.985
( theme music playing )

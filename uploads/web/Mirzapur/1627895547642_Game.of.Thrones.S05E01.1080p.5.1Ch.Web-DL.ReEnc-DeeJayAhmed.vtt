7
00:02:07.304 --> 00:02:09.806
- We shouldn't be out here alone.
- Why not?

8
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.775
- If your father...
- He'll never know we're gone.

9
00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:15.081
But if he finds out...

10
00:02:18.591 --> 00:02:21.493
You don't need
to be afraid of my father.

11
00:02:48.412 --> 00:02:50.904
Are you sure?

12
00:02:50.946 --> 00:02:52.542
Yes.

13
00:02:52.576 --> 00:02:55.941
- We shouldn't go in.
- Of course we should.

14
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.240
Get out. Get out!

15
00:03:43.274 --> 00:03:45.206
- Let's go.
- No.

16
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.070
Listen to your friend.

17
00:03:48.343 --> 00:03:50.877
They said that you
were terrifying

18
00:03:50.911 --> 00:03:54.141
with cat's teeth and three eyes.

19
00:03:54.183 --> 00:03:56.277
You're not terrifying.

20
00:03:57.615 --> 00:03:59.453
You're boring.

21
00:03:59.487 --> 00:04:01.749
You don't know what I am.

22
00:04:01.791 --> 00:04:05.124
I know you're a witch
and you can see the future.

23
00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:08.323
Tell me mine.

24
00:04:08.357 --> 00:04:10.563
Everyone wants
to know their future

25
00:04:10.597 --> 00:04:12.658
until they know their future.

26
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.959
This is my father's land.
My land.

27
00:04:15.993 --> 00:04:19.796
Tell me my future
or I'll have your two boring eyes

28
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.500
gouged out of your head.

29
00:04:30.471 --> 00:04:33.405
Your blood.

30
00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:35.270
Give me a taste.

31
00:05:00.382 --> 00:05:02.683
Three questions you get.

32
00:05:02.717 --> 00:05:05.483
You won't like the answers.

33
00:05:09.022 --> 00:05:12.555
I've been promised
to the prince.

34
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.659
When will we marry?

35
00:05:14.693 --> 00:05:16.530
You will never wed the prince.

36
00:05:16.564 --> 00:05:18.393
You will wed the king.

37
00:05:18.427 --> 00:05:19.960
But I will be queen?

38
00:05:19.994 --> 00:05:22.295
Oh, yes.

39
00:05:22.329 --> 00:05:24.767
You'll be queen.

40
00:05:24.801 --> 00:05:27.470
For a time.

41
00:05:27.504 --> 00:05:29.732
Then comes another,

42
00:05:29.766 --> 00:05:31.132
younger,

43
00:05:31.174 --> 00:05:33.636
more beautiful,

44
00:05:33.671 --> 00:05:37.877
to cast you down
and take all you hold dear.

45
00:05:37.911 --> 00:05:40.245
W-will the king and I
have children?

46
00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:44.053
No. The king
will have 20 children

47
00:05:44.087 --> 00:05:45.685
and you will have three.

48
00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:46.853
That doesn't make sense.

49
00:05:46.887 --> 00:05:50.221
Gold will be their crowns.

50
00:05:50.255 --> 00:05:53.357
Gold their shrouds.

51
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.933
Girl: Come on, we have to go.

52
00:06:03.606 --> 00:06:05.299
We have to go! Cersei!

53
00:06:09.306 --> 00:06:11.271
Man: Bearers, put it down.

54
00:06:27.595 --> 00:06:30.057
Man: Bearers, up.

55
00:06:30.091 --> 00:06:31.896
Away.

56
00:06:45.446 --> 00:06:48.212
High Septon: Your Grace, we are
honored by your presence.

57
00:06:48.246 --> 00:06:49.614
The mourners are waiting.

58
00:06:49.655 --> 00:06:52.455
They will keep waiting.

59
00:06:52.489 --> 00:06:54.055
I want a moment alone with him.

60
00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:56.623
But, Your Grace, many of these lords
and ladies have travelled

61
00:06:56.665 --> 00:06:58.959
day and night to be here from
all seven kingdoms.

62
00:06:58.993 --> 00:07:00.728
They will wait.

63
00:07:27.761 --> 00:07:29.823
He never wanted you
to be a Kingsguard,

64
00:07:29.865 --> 00:07:33.864
but here you are,
protecting his dead body.

65
00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:39.676
What he built, it's ours.

66
00:07:41.047 --> 00:07:43.783
He built it for us.
He meant it for us.

67
00:07:45.817 --> 00:07:47.351
They're going to try
to take it away.

68
00:07:47.385 --> 00:07:48.655
- All of it.
- They?

69
00:07:48.689 --> 00:07:51.223
All of them out there,
our enemies.

70
00:07:51.257 --> 00:07:54.063
They're waiting in line
to make sure he's really dead.

71
00:07:54.097 --> 00:07:55.895
And as soon as they see
the stones on his eyes,

72
00:07:55.929 --> 00:07:57.767
they'll set to work
on tearing us apart.

73
00:07:57.801 --> 00:08:00.568
They have nothing to do with it.

74
00:08:00.602 --> 00:08:02.736
The man who murdered our father,
he tore us apart.

75
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:05.168
He's the enemy.
I've been telling you for years.

76
00:08:05.242 --> 00:08:06.808
You've been defending
him for years.

77
00:08:06.842 --> 00:08:08.376
This is exactly what they want.

78
00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.208
And now our father is dead

79
00:08:10.242 --> 00:08:13.680
and that little monster is out there
somewhere drawing breath.

80
00:08:15.786 --> 00:08:17.921
Did you set him free?

81
00:08:20.427 --> 00:08:22.153
Tyrion may be a monster,

82
00:08:22.195 --> 00:08:26.161
but at least he killed
our father on purpose.

83
00:08:26.195 --> 00:08:28.265
You killed him by mistake.

84
00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:30.329
With stupidity.

85
00:08:31.539 --> 00:08:33.201
You're a man
of action, aren't you?

86
00:08:33.235 --> 00:08:35.472
When it occurs to you
to do something, you do it.

87
00:08:35.506 --> 00:08:38.704
Never mind the consequences.

88
00:08:40.674 --> 00:08:43.206
Take a look.

89
00:08:43.248 --> 00:08:45.141
Look at the consequences.

90
00:08:47.247 --> 00:08:49.316
Here they are.

91
00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:56.449
He loved you more than
anyone in this world.

92
00:10:28.684 --> 00:10:30.578
Apologies.

93
00:10:40.363 --> 00:10:43.624
I still don't see
why I had to stay

94
00:10:43.658 --> 00:10:46.696
in this fucking crate
once we set sail.

95
00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:48.632
I saved your life.

96
00:10:48.666 --> 00:10:51.431
If they catch you,
they catch me.

97
00:10:51.465 --> 00:10:53.471
I cannot say
I feel overly guilty

98
00:10:53.505 --> 00:10:55.535
about leaving you
in that fucking crate.

99
00:10:55.576 --> 00:10:58.302
Do you know what it's like
to stuff your shit

100
00:10:58.344 --> 00:11:00.038
through one of those airholes?

101
00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.006
No, I only know what it's like

102
00:11:02.048 --> 00:11:04.584
to pick up your shit
and throw it overboard.

103
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:09.855
Pentos?

104
00:11:09.889 --> 00:11:13.420
The home of my colleague
Illyrio Mopatis,

105
00:11:13.454 --> 00:11:14.924
a merchant.

106
00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.891
He and I met many years ago

107
00:11:16.925 --> 00:11:19.027
through mutual friends.

108
00:11:19.061 --> 00:11:21.531
A group of people
who saw Robert Baratheon

109
00:11:21.565 --> 00:11:23.900
for the disaster he was.

110
00:11:23.934 --> 00:11:26.132
We tried to do what
was best for the realm

111
00:11:26.166 --> 00:11:29.573
by supporting
a Targaryen restoration.

112
00:11:29.607 --> 00:11:32.278
And thus began
the chain of mistakes

113
00:11:32.312 --> 00:11:34.775
that has led us both here.

114
00:11:34.817 --> 00:11:38.350
Things have gotten worse,
not better.

115
00:11:38.384 --> 00:11:41.652
Westeros needs to be
saved from itself.

116
00:11:45.254 --> 00:11:47.123
Mmm.

117
00:11:47.157 --> 00:11:48.691
Much better.

118
00:11:48.725 --> 00:11:50.491
My lord?

119
00:11:52.292 --> 00:11:55.131
I don't think I am anymore.

120
00:11:55.165 --> 00:11:57.531
A lord.

121
00:12:05.139 --> 00:12:08.105
Are you a lord
if you kill your father?

122
00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:13.112
I don't imagine
they revoke your nobility

123
00:12:13.146 --> 00:12:15.079
for killing a whore.

124
00:12:15.113 --> 00:12:16.813
It must happen all the time.

125
00:12:16.847 --> 00:12:19.349
You already drank yourself
across the Narrow Sea.

126
00:12:19.383 --> 00:12:21.318
In a box. Why stop now?

127
00:12:21.352 --> 00:12:24.592
Because we are talking
about the future of our country.

128
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.266
The future is shit.

129
00:12:33.236 --> 00:12:35.339
Just like the past.

130
00:14:55.284 --> 00:14:57.417
Shh.

131
00:14:57.451 --> 00:14:59.217
Shh.

132
00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.397
Daenerys: The Sons of the Harpy?

133
00:15:44.431 --> 00:15:46.668
Yes, Your Grace.
They left it on the body.

134
00:15:46.702 --> 00:15:48.131
They've never killed before.

135
00:15:48.173 --> 00:15:50.539
It was only a matter
of time, Your Grace.

136
00:15:50.573 --> 00:15:52.938
Conquerors always meet
with resistance.

137
00:15:52.972 --> 00:15:55.208
I didn't conquer them.
Their own people did.

138
00:16:03.452 --> 00:16:06.219
He did not risk his life
fighting for his freedom

139
00:16:06.253 --> 00:16:08.220
so cowards in masks
could take it away.

140
00:16:08.254 --> 00:16:10.124
And I did not take up
residence in this pyramid

141
00:16:10.158 --> 00:16:13.997
so I could watch the city below
decline into chaos.

142
00:16:14.031 --> 00:16:16.630
What was the name
of the man you lost?

143
00:16:16.672 --> 00:16:19.206
White Rat, Your Grace.

144
00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:23.340
I want him buried
with honor, publically

145
00:16:23.374 --> 00:16:25.675
in the Temple of the Graces.

146
00:16:25.709 --> 00:16:27.906
The Sons of the Harpy
will hear that message.

147
00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:29.473
Make them very angry.

148
00:16:29.507 --> 00:16:31.441
Angry snakes lash out.

149
00:16:31.474 --> 00:16:34.207
Makes chopping off their heads
that much easier.

150
00:16:34.249 --> 00:16:37.782
Find the men who did this
and bring them to me.

151
00:16:41.086 --> 00:16:43.083
Your Grace.

152
00:16:56.697 --> 00:16:58.463
Torgo Nudho.

153
00:16:58.497 --> 00:17:00.527
Missandei hin Naath.

154
00:17:02.571 --> 00:17:04.202
I wanted to speak with you.

155
00:17:12.881 --> 00:17:15.111
Why do you come?

156
00:17:15.145 --> 00:17:18.311
White Rat, the Unsullied who...

157
00:17:20.353 --> 00:17:23.718
I have heard they found
his body in a brothel.

158
00:17:25.055 --> 00:17:27.617
I have heard that
more than one Unsullied

159
00:17:27.651 --> 00:17:30.584
has been known to visit
Meereen's brothels.

160
00:17:33.393 --> 00:17:35.190
May I ask you why?

161
00:17:36.592 --> 00:17:39.262
Why would an Unsullied
go to a brothel?

162
00:17:43.536 --> 00:17:45.670
I do not know.

163
00:17:47.408 --> 00:17:49.302
I must go.

164
00:18:04.922 --> 00:18:06.992
- Get your shield up.
- It's too heavy.

165
00:18:07.026 --> 00:18:08.624
If it wasn't heavy,
it wouldn't stop a sword.

166
00:18:08.658 --> 00:18:10.295
Now get it up.

167
00:18:22.631 --> 00:18:25.195
Come. Try it again.

168
00:18:25.229 --> 00:18:28.298
Drive at me.
Keep your shield up.

169
00:18:28.332 --> 00:18:30.634
Or I'll ring
your head like a bell.

170
00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:33.505
Shouldn't you be training, too?

171
00:18:33.539 --> 00:18:37.138
Well, I'm hardly a new recruit.

172
00:18:39.181 --> 00:18:42.779
How many brothers can say that they've
killed a white walker and a Thenn?

173
00:18:42.813 --> 00:18:44.883
I might be the first in history.

174
00:18:44.917 --> 00:18:47.019
- Man: Shield up.
- Alliser: These men need a firm hand.

175
00:18:47.053 --> 00:18:48.820
Always have.

176
00:18:48.854 --> 00:18:51.995
They're poachers and thieves.

177
00:18:53.726 --> 00:18:55.660
Not soldiers.

178
00:19:01.264 --> 00:19:03.293
That one hates me.

179
00:19:04.965 --> 00:19:07.299
Sam: If Ser Alliser is chosen
as the new Lord Commander...

180
00:19:07.333 --> 00:19:11.035
- He hates the wildlings.

181
00:19:11.069 --> 00:19:12.666
All the wildlings.

182
00:19:12.708 --> 00:19:15.137
- Don't let them send us away.
- It's not a sure thing.

183
00:19:15.171 --> 00:19:17.979
Ser Denys Mallister has commanded
the Shadow Tower for 20 years

184
00:19:18.013 --> 00:19:19.643
and people say he's a good man.

185
00:19:19.677 --> 00:19:20.947
He's running against
Ser Alliser...

186
00:19:20.981 --> 00:19:23.652
Sam, don't let them
send us away.

187
00:19:23.686 --> 00:19:25.652
I told you.

188
00:19:25.686 --> 00:19:27.956
Wherever you go, I go, too.

189
00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:30.420
You can't leave.
They'll execute you.

190
00:19:38.029 --> 00:19:41.036
- Good, good, pivot. Don't forget to pivot.
- Yah!

191
00:19:41.934 --> 00:19:44.004
Shield up.

192
00:19:45.478 --> 00:19:47.572
The king wants a word.

193
00:20:15.768 --> 00:20:17.062
You're not cold, my lady?

194
00:20:17.104 --> 00:20:19.998
Never.

195
00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:23.438
The Lord's fire lives
within me, Jon Snow.

196
00:20:26.041 --> 00:20:27.880
Feel.

197
00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:36.952
Are you a virgin?

198
00:20:40.532 --> 00:20:42.594
No.

199
00:20:44.068 --> 00:20:45.961
Good.

200
00:20:52.737 --> 00:20:55.070
Your Grace.

201
00:20:55.104 --> 00:20:57.468
The bastard of Winterfell.

202
00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.278
You know who rules
at Winterfell now?

203
00:21:09.216 --> 00:21:10.814
Roose Bolton.

204
00:21:10.848 --> 00:21:14.484
Mmm, the traitor who plunged
a dagger in Robb Stark's heart.

205
00:21:15.853 --> 00:21:17.914
Don't you want to avenge him?

206
00:21:19.187 --> 00:21:21.955
I want a great
many things, Your Grace.

207
00:21:21.988 --> 00:21:24.556
But I'm a sworn brother
of the Night's Watch now.

208
00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:27.829
I've been talking
to your sworn brothers.

209
00:21:27.863 --> 00:21:29.797
- Many of them love you.
- They're good men.

210
00:21:29.831 --> 00:21:31.469
Many don't.

211
00:21:31.503 --> 00:21:35.573
You were seen taking the body
of a wildling girl north of the Wall.

212
00:21:35.607 --> 00:21:37.108
Why?

213
00:21:37.142 --> 00:21:38.940
It's where she belonged.

214
00:21:38.974 --> 00:21:40.571
Some of the Night's
Watch feel you have

215
00:21:40.645 --> 00:21:42.578
too much affection
for the wildlings.

216
00:21:42.612 --> 00:21:45.113
They were born
on the wrong side of the Wall.

217
00:21:45.147 --> 00:21:47.145
That doesn't make them monsters.

218
00:21:47.179 --> 00:21:48.376
No matter.

219
00:21:48.418 --> 00:21:49.846
I shall take back the North

220
00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.308
from the thieves who stole it.

221
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:53.779
Tywin Lannister is dead.
He can't protect them now.

222
00:21:53.813 --> 00:21:57.451
I shall mount
Roose Bolton's head on a spike.

223
00:21:57.485 --> 00:22:00.020
But if I'm to take Winterfell,
I need more men.

224
00:22:00.054 --> 00:22:02.954
The men of the Night's Watch
are sworn to play no part...

225
00:22:02.988 --> 00:22:05.154
I'm not talking about
the damn Night's Watch.

226
00:22:05.188 --> 00:22:07.191
I'm talking about the wildlings.

227
00:22:15.805 --> 00:22:19.037
Your Grace,
you want the wildlings

228
00:22:19.111 --> 00:22:20.878
to march in your army?

229
00:22:20.912 --> 00:22:22.942
If they swear to follow me,
I'll pardon them.

230
00:22:22.984 --> 00:22:24.781
We'll take Winterfell.
Once the North is won,

231
00:22:24.815 --> 00:22:26.684
I'll declare them
citizens of the realm.

232
00:22:26.718 --> 00:22:28.884
I'll give them land to live on.

233
00:22:28.918 --> 00:22:32.219
It's a fair offer.
More than fair.

234
00:22:32.253 --> 00:22:34.187
I'll offer them their lives
and their freedom

235
00:22:34.221 --> 00:22:37.225
if Mance kneels before me
and swears his loyalty.

236
00:22:37.259 --> 00:22:39.024
I don't think that's likely.

237
00:22:41.225 --> 00:22:42.496
You admire him, don't you?

238
00:22:42.562 --> 00:22:45.329
- I respect him.
- He likes you.

239
00:22:45.363 --> 00:22:47.265
- Convince him to bend the knee...
- Your Grace.

240
00:22:47.299 --> 00:22:48.769
Or he burns.

241
00:22:52.507 --> 00:22:54.042
How much time do I have?

242
00:22:54.076 --> 00:22:55.577
Nightfall.

243
00:22:55.611 --> 00:22:58.009
The sun drops fast
this time of year.

244
00:22:58.043 --> 00:23:00.546
Hurry, Jon Snow.

245
00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.650
Master-of-arms: Shield up.

246
00:23:04.684 --> 00:23:07.721
Master-of-arms: Attack, my lord!

247
00:23:07.755 --> 00:23:09.825
Attack!

248
00:23:09.859 --> 00:23:12.518
Don't cross your feet.

249
00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.325
My sons had swords
in their hands

250
00:23:14.359 --> 00:23:15.820
from the time they could walk.
This one...

251
00:23:15.862 --> 00:23:18.154
Littlefinger: Lord Arryn will never
be a great warrior.

252
00:23:18.196 --> 00:23:20.163
Royce: Great warrior?

253
00:23:20.197 --> 00:23:22.858
He swings a sword
like a girl with palsy.

254
00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.593
My lord.

255
00:23:25.635 --> 00:23:27.498
Master-of-arms:
Sword up, my lord!

256
00:23:35.142 --> 00:23:37.011
Some boys develop more slowly.

257
00:23:37.045 --> 00:23:39.241
He's still young.

258
00:23:39.283 --> 00:23:42.344
He's 13. Boys go to war at 13.

259
00:23:42.378 --> 00:23:44.385
- He has other gifts.
- Does he?

260
00:23:44.419 --> 00:23:47.217
The gift of a great name.

261
00:23:47.251 --> 00:23:51.025
Sometimes that's all one needs.

262
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:58.606
Good-bye, Lord Royce,
and thank you for all you've done for me.

263
00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.071
I have done nothing more
than my duty, my lady.

264
00:24:01.105 --> 00:24:02.944
I have no doubt
that on my return,

265
00:24:02.978 --> 00:24:05.310
Robin's skills will have
improved immeasurably.

266
00:24:05.344 --> 00:24:07.445
He'll be safe here.

267
00:24:07.479 --> 00:24:10.413
As for his skills,

268
00:24:10.447 --> 00:24:12.852
I make no promises.

269
00:24:25.599 --> 00:24:28.732
Will we head north
at some point?

270
00:24:28.766 --> 00:24:32.171
He said Sansa had a brother
at Castle Black.

271
00:24:32.205 --> 00:24:34.667
We're a few days' ride
from the Kingsroad.

272
00:24:34.709 --> 00:24:37.170
- But that will take us...
- Us?

273
00:24:38.971 --> 00:24:41.376
The only reason you're here
is because Jaime Lannister

274
00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:43.344
told me you weren't
safe in the capital.

275
00:24:45.249 --> 00:24:48.184
You're hundreds of miles
from King's Landing.

276
00:24:48.218 --> 00:24:50.182
No one knows what you look like.

277
00:24:50.216 --> 00:24:53.316
No one cares. You're safe.

278
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:56.350
- But I'm your squire.
- Do you even know what a squire is?

279
00:24:57.992 --> 00:24:59.591
An attendant to a knight.

280
00:24:59.625 --> 00:25:01.223
I'm not a knight.

281
00:25:01.265 --> 00:25:03.432
That means you're not a squire.

282
00:25:03.466 --> 00:25:04.730
Well, where would I go?

283
00:25:04.772 --> 00:25:07.634
I don't care.
I'm not your mother.

284
00:25:16.182 --> 00:25:18.251
You swore to find
the Stark girls.

285
00:25:18.285 --> 00:25:20.882
I found Arya.
She didn't want my protection.

286
00:25:20.916 --> 00:25:23.480
- Sansa still might.
- Will you shut your mouth?

287
00:25:24.418 --> 00:25:26.486
I didn't ask for your advice.

288
00:25:28.152 --> 00:25:30.991
I don't want anyone
following me.

289
00:25:31.026 --> 00:25:32.727
I'm not a leader.

290
00:25:32.761 --> 00:25:35.726
All I ever wanted
was to fight for a lord I believed in.

291
00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.895
The good lords are dead
and the rest are monsters.

292
00:25:49.714 --> 00:25:52.080
You told Lord Royce
we were going to the Fingers.

293
00:25:52.114 --> 00:25:54.248
I did.

294
00:25:54.282 --> 00:25:57.350
- But we're heading west.
- We are.

295
00:25:57.384 --> 00:25:59.550
If he wanted to betray us,
he already would have.

296
00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:04.494
Lord Royce might be as honorable
as he thinks he is,

297
00:26:04.528 --> 00:26:06.788
but he's not alone
in that castle.

298
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:08.827
Do you trust all those
knights and ladies,

299
00:26:08.861 --> 00:26:11.026
stable boys and serving girls?

300
00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:14.234
No, do you trust the carriage driver
or the knights escorting us?

301
00:26:14.268 --> 00:26:16.561
No.

302
00:26:16.603 --> 00:26:18.264
But I pay them well

303
00:26:18.298 --> 00:26:20.702
and they've seen what happens
to men who disappoint me.

304
00:26:20.736 --> 00:26:22.999
So where are we going?

305
00:26:23.041 --> 00:26:25.336
To a land where
you trust everyone?

306
00:26:25.378 --> 00:26:27.943
To a land so far from here,

307
00:26:27.977 --> 00:26:31.046
even Cersei Lannister
can't get her hands on you.

308
00:26:38.824 --> 00:26:42.286
It was such a deep,
deep shock to us all.

309
00:26:45.724 --> 00:26:47.626
Your father was a...

310
00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:49.793
A force to be reckoned with.

311
00:26:49.827 --> 00:26:51.760
He truly was.

312
00:26:51.794 --> 00:26:54.095
I wouldn't presume to claim

313
00:26:54.129 --> 00:26:56.160
to have known him as such, but...

314
00:26:56.202 --> 00:26:59.803
But just being in his presence
was enough to make it so clear

315
00:26:59.837 --> 00:27:02.877
just how formidable
a person you were dealing with.

316
00:27:02.911 --> 00:27:06.380
What a... what a force
to be reckoned with.

317
00:27:08.046 --> 00:27:10.548
Thank you so much
for your kind words.

318
00:27:15.086 --> 00:27:17.492
Deepest condolences, Your Grace.

319
00:27:17.525 --> 00:27:20.521
This tragedy...
I never trusted Varys.

320
00:27:20.555 --> 00:27:22.793
I often warned...

321
00:27:26.362 --> 00:27:27.694
Your Grace.

322
00:27:30.262 --> 00:27:32.826
Cousin Lancel.
I hardly recognized you.

323
00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.065
My deepest sympathies.

324
00:27:35.099 --> 00:27:38.169
I apologize for my son's
appearance.

325
00:27:38.203 --> 00:27:40.002
Uncle, it's quite all right.

326
00:27:42.644 --> 00:27:44.842
They call themselves sparrows.

327
00:27:44.876 --> 00:27:47.410
Bloody fanatics.

328
00:27:47.444 --> 00:27:49.410
Religion has its place,
of course,

329
00:27:49.444 --> 00:27:52.082
but at a certain point...

330
00:27:52.116 --> 00:27:55.249
They never would have come
to the capital when Tywin was alive.

331
00:27:55.283 --> 00:27:56.985
I'm sure he'll grow out of it,

332
00:27:57.019 --> 00:27:58.985
whatever it is.

333
00:27:59.019 --> 00:28:01.592
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

334
00:28:19.738 --> 00:28:22.472
Your wounds from the Blackwater
seem to have healed.

335
00:28:22.506 --> 00:28:26.007
It wasn't my wounds
that needed healing.

336
00:28:28.577 --> 00:28:30.710
What can I do for you?

337
00:28:31.712 --> 00:28:33.677
You can forgive me.

338
00:28:33.711 --> 00:28:36.549
What could you possibly
have done to warrant my forgiveness?

339
00:28:36.582 --> 00:28:39.315
I led you into the darkness.

340
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:41.651
I doubt you've ever
led anyone anywhere.

341
00:28:41.685 --> 00:28:44.492
I tempted you into our...

342
00:28:44.526 --> 00:28:47.124
unnatural relations.

343
00:28:48.359 --> 00:28:51.937
And, of course,
there was the king...

344
00:28:53.404 --> 00:28:55.474
his boar hunt.

345
00:28:57.275 --> 00:28:58.537
His wine.

346
00:29:02.009 --> 00:29:04.676
I don't know what
you're talking about.

347
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:07.308
I'm a different person now.

348
00:29:08.749 --> 00:29:11.714
I've found peace
in the light of the Seven.

349
00:29:11.748 --> 00:29:13.250
You can, too.

350
00:29:13.284 --> 00:29:14.953
They watch over all of us,

351
00:29:14.987 --> 00:29:17.584
ready to dole out mercy

352
00:29:17.618 --> 00:29:19.215
or justice.

353
00:29:22.719 --> 00:29:24.822
Their world is at hand.

354
00:29:27.432 --> 00:29:29.126
I will pray for
your father's soul.

355
00:29:31.633 --> 00:29:35.503
The day Tywin Lannister's
soul needs your help...

356
00:29:43.975 --> 00:29:46.677
- Olyvar: It looks like Dorne.
- Loras: It doesn't.

357
00:29:46.751 --> 00:29:49.445
It does.

358
00:29:49.487 --> 00:29:53.789
That's the...
That's the Sunspear bit right there.

359
00:29:54.959 --> 00:29:57.493
And that's where
the mountains are.

360
00:29:57.527 --> 00:29:59.957
And over here is...

361
00:29:59.991 --> 00:30:02.797
Is Sunsnake?

362
00:30:02.831 --> 00:30:04.293
Stonespear?

363
00:30:04.335 --> 00:30:05.901
Sandstone.

364
00:30:05.935 --> 00:30:07.565
Yes.

365
00:30:07.599 --> 00:30:09.899
Yes, Sandstone.

366
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:12.705
Just there.

367
00:30:12.739 --> 00:30:14.736
Fine.

368
00:30:17.306 --> 00:30:19.040
It's Dorne.

369
00:30:20.273 --> 00:30:22.406
We should go there.

370
00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:25.712
I think we would
have a lovely time,

371
00:30:25.746 --> 00:30:28.016
judging by my experience.

372
00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:32.024
That would be wonderful.
Dorne, Highgarden.

373
00:30:32.058 --> 00:30:33.687
Anywhere but here.

374
00:30:42.599 --> 00:30:44.732
We're late for dinner as it is.

375
00:30:45.599 --> 00:30:47.029
You're very respectful.

376
00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:48.965
I'm very hungry.

377
00:31:05.641 --> 00:31:08.206
What's your name?

378
00:31:08.272 --> 00:31:09.974
Olyvar, my lady.

379
00:31:10.008 --> 00:31:11.647
I'm afraid my brother

380
00:31:11.681 --> 00:31:15.449
is keeping the king
waiting, Olyvar.

381
00:31:24.166 --> 00:31:26.231
My lady.

382
00:31:39.263 --> 00:31:43.229
Perhaps you might
consider being a bit more discreet?

383
00:31:43.263 --> 00:31:44.836
Why?

384
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:47.098
They all know about me anyway.

385
00:31:47.133 --> 00:31:50.336
Everybody knows everything
about everyone.

386
00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:52.671
What's the point in trying to keep
a secret in a place like this?

387
00:31:52.704 --> 00:31:56.338
In any event, you shouldn't
keep your intended waiting.

388
00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:59.634
My intended? Please.

389
00:31:59.675 --> 00:32:01.105
Tywin's dead.

390
00:32:01.139 --> 00:32:03.241
That means no one
can force Cersei to marry me.

391
00:32:03.275 --> 00:32:05.409
- Lucky you.
- Unlucky you.

392
00:32:05.443 --> 00:32:07.177
You think I want
that woman married to my brother?

393
00:32:07.211 --> 00:32:11.049
If she doesn't marry me,
she doesn't go to Highgarden.

394
00:32:11.083 --> 00:32:13.417
Which means she stays
in King's Landing.

395
00:32:13.451 --> 00:32:17.289
Which means you're trapped here with
Cersei Lannister as your mother by law.

396
00:32:17.323 --> 00:32:18.993
Perhaps.

397
00:32:20.027 --> 00:32:22.026
Perhaps?

398
00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:23.961
Perhaps.

399
00:32:37.507 --> 00:32:39.514
Eunuch, the Spider,

400
00:32:39.548 --> 00:32:41.377
the Master of Whisperers.

401
00:32:41.411 --> 00:32:43.848
Imp, Half-man.

402
00:32:46.153 --> 00:32:48.348
There are faster ways
to kill yourself.

403
00:32:48.382 --> 00:32:50.146
Not for a coward.

404
00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:52.183
You are many things, my friend,

405
00:32:52.217 --> 00:32:54.215
but not a coward.

406
00:32:57.786 --> 00:33:00.256
You never told me
why you set me free.

407
00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:03.190
Your brother asked me to.

408
00:33:03.224 --> 00:33:04.830
Could have said no.

409
00:33:04.864 --> 00:33:07.597
Refuse the Kingslayer?
A dangerous proposition.

410
00:33:07.631 --> 00:33:09.796
Not as dangerous
as releasing me.

411
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:12.565
You risked your life,
your position, everything.

412
00:33:12.599 --> 00:33:15.303
Why? You're not family.
You owe me nothing.

413
00:33:15.337 --> 00:33:17.777
I didn't do it for you.

414
00:33:17.811 --> 00:33:19.810
I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.

415
00:33:19.844 --> 00:33:23.219
A drunken dwarf will never be
the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.

416
00:33:23.253 --> 00:33:25.418
I don't believe in saviors.

417
00:33:25.452 --> 00:33:29.153
I believe men of talent
have a part to play in the war to come.

418
00:33:30.588 --> 00:33:33.059
You're going to have
to find another soldier.

419
00:33:33.093 --> 00:33:36.331
I'm done with Westeros
and Westeros is done with me.

420
00:33:36.365 --> 00:33:39.497
You have many
admirable qualities,

421
00:33:39.531 --> 00:33:41.000
self-pity is not one of them.

422
00:33:41.034 --> 00:33:43.231
Any fool with a bit of luck

423
00:33:43.265 --> 00:33:46.670
can find himself
born into power.

424
00:33:46.704 --> 00:33:50.405
But earning it for yourself,
that takes work.

425
00:33:50.439 --> 00:33:53.044
I'm not well-suited for work.

426
00:33:53.078 --> 00:33:54.541
I think you are.

427
00:33:54.575 --> 00:33:56.814
You have your father's
instincts for politics.

428
00:33:56.848 --> 00:33:58.278
And you have compassion.

429
00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:01.383
Compassion? Yes.

430
00:34:01.417 --> 00:34:04.888
I killed my lover
with my bare hands.

431
00:34:04.922 --> 00:34:07.930
I shot my own father
with a crossbow.

432
00:34:07.964 --> 00:34:10.764
I never said you were perfect.

433
00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.944
What is it you want exactly?

434
00:34:13.978 --> 00:34:15.944
Peace.

435
00:34:15.978 --> 00:34:18.008
Prosperity.

436
00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:21.384
A land where the powerful
do not prey on the powerless.

437
00:34:21.418 --> 00:34:23.751
Where the castles
are made of gingerbread

438
00:34:23.784 --> 00:34:26.349
and the moats are filled
with blackberry wine.

439
00:34:26.383 --> 00:34:28.589
The powerful have always
preyed on the powerless.

440
00:34:28.623 --> 00:34:31.125
That's how they became powerful
in the first place.

441
00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:33.060
Perhaps.

442
00:34:33.094 --> 00:34:36.524
And perhaps we've grown
so used to horror,

443
00:34:36.558 --> 00:34:38.491
we assume there's no other way.

444
00:34:39.765 --> 00:34:41.868
If you sat on the Iron Throne,

445
00:34:41.902 --> 00:34:44.203
would you spread misery
throughout the land?

446
00:34:44.237 --> 00:34:46.739
I will never sit
on the Iron Throne.

447
00:34:46.773 --> 00:34:48.875
No, you won't.

448
00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:51.372
But you could help another
climb those steps

449
00:34:51.414 --> 00:34:53.780
and take that seat.

450
00:34:53.814 --> 00:34:57.013
The Seven Kingdoms
need someone stronger than Tommen,

451
00:34:57.047 --> 00:34:59.052
but gentler than Stannis.

452
00:34:59.086 --> 00:35:02.925
A monarch who can intimidate
the high lords and inspire the people.

453
00:35:02.959 --> 00:35:06.191
A ruler loved by millions
with a powerful army

454
00:35:06.225 --> 00:35:08.064
and the right family name.

455
00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:10.327
Good luck finding him.

456
00:35:10.369 --> 00:35:13.598
Who said anything about "him"?

457
00:35:17.372 --> 00:35:19.632
You have a choice, my friend.

458
00:35:19.666 --> 00:35:21.831
You can stay here
at Illyrio's palace

459
00:35:21.873 --> 00:35:24.302
and drink yourself to death,

460
00:35:24.336 --> 00:35:26.572
or you can ride with me
to Meereen,

461
00:35:26.606 --> 00:35:28.136
meet Daenerys Targaryen,

462
00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:30.701
and decide if the world
is worth fighting for.

463
00:35:33.098 --> 00:35:36.766
Can I drink myself to death
on the road to Meereen?

464
00:35:47.247 --> 00:35:49.983
When did the Unsullied
start patrolling the streets of Meereen?

465
00:35:50.017 --> 00:35:53.289
Looks like your friends haven't
been behaving themselves.

466
00:35:56.158 --> 00:35:58.997
Our mission to Yunkai
was a resounding success.

467
00:35:59.031 --> 00:36:01.597
The Wise Masters of Yunkai
have agreed to cede power

468
00:36:01.631 --> 00:36:03.501
to a council of elders
made up of both

469
00:36:03.535 --> 00:36:05.837
the freed men
and the former slaveholders.

470
00:36:05.871 --> 00:36:09.142
All matters of consequence will be
brought to you for review.

471
00:36:09.176 --> 00:36:10.742
Good.

472
00:36:10.776 --> 00:36:12.582
They did ask
for some concessions.

473
00:36:12.616 --> 00:36:14.982
Concessions?

474
00:36:15.016 --> 00:36:17.246
Politics is the art
of compromise, Your Grace.

475
00:36:17.288 --> 00:36:20.182
I'm not a politician.
I'm a queen.

476
00:36:20.224 --> 00:36:23.391
Hizdahr: Forgive me.
You're right, of course.

477
00:36:23.425 --> 00:36:27.727
Still, it's easier to rule
happy subjects than angry ones.

478
00:36:27.761 --> 00:36:29.927
I don't expect the Wise Masters
to be happy.

479
00:36:29.969 --> 00:36:33.031
Slavery made them rich.
I ended slavery.

480
00:36:33.065 --> 00:36:36.104
They do not ask
for the return of slavery.

481
00:36:36.138 --> 00:36:39.009
They ask for the reopening
of the fighting pits.

482
00:36:39.948 --> 00:36:41.515
The fighting pits?

483
00:36:41.549 --> 00:36:43.919
Where slaves fought
slaves to the death?

484
00:36:43.953 --> 00:36:46.025
In the new world
that you've brought to us,

485
00:36:46.059 --> 00:36:48.530
free men would fight free men.

486
00:36:49.732 --> 00:36:51.227
The pit fighters you liberated

487
00:36:51.269 --> 00:36:53.299
plead for this opportunity.

488
00:36:53.333 --> 00:36:55.771
Bring some here
and ask them yourself.

489
00:36:55.805 --> 00:36:56.867
No fighting pits.

490
00:36:56.908 --> 00:36:58.971
Opening them would show
the people of Yunkai

491
00:36:59.005 --> 00:37:00.973
and Meereen that you
respect their traditions.

492
00:37:01.016 --> 00:37:03.897
I do not respect the tradition of
human cockfighting.

493
00:37:03.898 --> 00:37:04.717
If you could...

494
00:37:04.741 --> 00:37:06.741
How many times must I say no
before you understand?

495
00:37:10.028 --> 00:37:12.488
Whatever he wants from me,
he's not going to get it.

496
00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:15.127
If he really believes
I'm going to reopen the fighting pits...

497
00:37:15.161 --> 00:37:18.262
You should reopen
the fighting pits.

498
00:37:18.296 --> 00:37:20.165
What?

499
00:37:20.199 --> 00:37:22.902
My mother was a whore.
I told you that.

500
00:37:24.768 --> 00:37:27.271
She liked to drink pear brandy.

501
00:37:27.305 --> 00:37:30.542
The older she got,
the less she made selling her body,

502
00:37:30.576 --> 00:37:32.845
the more she wanted to drink.

503
00:37:32.879 --> 00:37:36.213
So one day when I was 12,
she sold me to a slaver

504
00:37:36.247 --> 00:37:38.917
she fucked the night before.

505
00:37:38.951 --> 00:37:41.150
I'm sorry.

506
00:37:41.184 --> 00:37:43.918
Why? I was a bad child.

507
00:37:43.992 --> 00:37:47.591
I wasn't big, but I was quick.

508
00:37:47.625 --> 00:37:49.031
And I loved to fight.

509
00:37:49.065 --> 00:37:51.032
So they sold me
to a man in Tolos

510
00:37:51.066 --> 00:37:53.167
who trained fighters
for the pits.

511
00:37:53.201 --> 00:37:55.903
I had my first match
when I was 16.

512
00:37:55.936 --> 00:37:57.806
You were sold into slavery,

513
00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:00.372
forced to fight to the death
for the amusement of the masters,

514
00:38:00.406 --> 00:38:01.926
and you're defending
the fighting pits?

515
00:38:03.509 --> 00:38:06.306
I'm only here
because of those pits.

516
00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:09.008
I learned to fight
like a Dothraki screamer,

517
00:38:09.042 --> 00:38:11.343
a Norvoshi priest,
a Westerosi knight.

518
00:38:11.377 --> 00:38:13.047
Soon I was famous.

519
00:38:13.081 --> 00:38:15.246
10,000 men and women
screamed my name

520
00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.814
when I stepped into the pit.

521
00:38:16.848 --> 00:38:18.718
I made so much money
for my master,

522
00:38:18.752 --> 00:38:21.551
he set me free when he died.

523
00:38:21.585 --> 00:38:23.391
I joined the Second Sons.

524
00:38:23.426 --> 00:38:25.560
And then I met you.

525
00:38:30.962 --> 00:38:33.000
You're the queen.

526
00:38:33.034 --> 00:38:35.832
Everyone's too afraid
of you to speak truth.

527
00:38:35.874 --> 00:38:38.303
Everyone but me.

528
00:38:38.337 --> 00:38:42.471
You've made thousands
of enemies all across the world.

529
00:38:42.513 --> 00:38:45.311
As soon as they see weakness,

530
00:38:45.345 --> 00:38:47.511
they'll attack.

531
00:38:47.545 --> 00:38:50.950
Show your strength here, now.

532
00:38:50.984 --> 00:38:53.381
That's why I have the Unsullied
patrolling the streets.

533
00:38:55.486 --> 00:38:59.092
Anyone with a chest full of gold
can buy an army of Unsullied.

534
00:38:59.126 --> 00:39:02.827
You're not
the Mother of Unsullied.

535
00:39:02.861 --> 00:39:04.859
You're the Mother of Dragons.

536
00:39:11.533 --> 00:39:15.635
I don't want another child's bones
dropped at my feet.

537
00:39:16.774 --> 00:39:19.308
No one's seen Drogon in weeks.

538
00:39:19.342 --> 00:39:22.116
For all I know, he's flown halfway
across the world.

539
00:39:26.885 --> 00:39:29.187
I can't control them anymore.

540
00:39:30.325 --> 00:39:33.923
A dragon queen with no dragons

541
00:39:33.957 --> 00:39:36.059
is not a queen.

542
00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:43.887
Viserion?

543
00:40:45.889 --> 00:40:47.792
Rhaegal?

544
00:40:59.803 --> 00:41:01.136
Easy. Easy.

545
00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:03.471
Easy.

546
00:41:42.879 --> 00:41:45.013
So here we are.

547
00:41:45.047 --> 00:41:47.117
Here we are.

548
00:41:48.752 --> 00:41:52.550
When we first met,
you were my prisoner.

549
00:41:52.592 --> 00:41:55.959
And now, for our last meeting...

550
00:41:58.033 --> 00:42:00.696
This doesn't have to be
our last meeting.

551
00:42:00.730 --> 00:42:03.265
No, but it will be.

552
00:42:05.508 --> 00:42:07.937
You know what Stannis wants?

553
00:42:07.971 --> 00:42:10.376
He wants me to bend the knee.

554
00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:13.680
And he wants the free folk
to fight for him.

555
00:42:13.714 --> 00:42:16.047
I'll give him this much,

556
00:42:16.081 --> 00:42:17.310
he's bold.

557
00:42:17.344 --> 00:42:18.950
Shouldn't a king be bold?

558
00:42:18.984 --> 00:42:21.014
Oh, aye.

559
00:42:21.048 --> 00:42:24.119
I respect him.

560
00:42:24.152 --> 00:42:25.559
If he gets what he wants,

561
00:42:25.593 --> 00:42:28.127
I expect he'll be
a better ruler than the fools

562
00:42:28.161 --> 00:42:31.263
sitting on the Iron Throne
the last hundred years.

563
00:42:31.298 --> 00:42:33.864
But I'll never serve him.

564
00:42:35.066 --> 00:42:36.664
You told me you weren't
here to conquer.

565
00:42:36.706 --> 00:42:38.137
You told me your people
have bled enough.

566
00:42:38.171 --> 00:42:40.241
That's right.

567
00:42:40.275 --> 00:42:42.873
I don't want them bleeding for
Stannis Baratheon either.

568
00:42:42.907 --> 00:42:46.450
You spent your life
convincing 90 clans to come together

569
00:42:46.484 --> 00:42:48.514
for the first time in history.

570
00:42:48.548 --> 00:42:50.652
Thenns and Hornfoots,

571
00:42:50.686 --> 00:42:53.725
the ice-river clans,
even the giants.

572
00:42:53.759 --> 00:42:57.726
A life's work uniting them.
You didn't do it for power.

573
00:42:57.768 --> 00:43:00.231
You didn't do it for glory.

574
00:43:00.265 --> 00:43:02.302
You brought them
together to save them

575
00:43:02.336 --> 00:43:03.933
because none of them
will survive the winter,

576
00:43:03.967 --> 00:43:05.636
not if they're north
of the Wall.

577
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:07.835
Isn't their survival
more important than your pride?

578
00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:09.740
Pride?

579
00:43:11.878 --> 00:43:14.508
Fuck my pride.

580
00:43:16.551 --> 00:43:18.981
This isn't about that.

581
00:43:20.383 --> 00:43:24.086
Then bend the knee
and save your people.

582
00:43:25.792 --> 00:43:29.158
They followed me
because they respected me.

583
00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:30.928
Because they believed in me.

584
00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:33.432
The moment I kneel
for a southern king, that's all gone.

585
00:43:33.466 --> 00:43:36.672
And how many tens of thousands
are out there right now?

586
00:43:36.706 --> 00:43:39.873
How many women?
How many children?

587
00:43:39.907 --> 00:43:43.113
And you won't go out and rescue
them because why?

588
00:43:43.147 --> 00:43:45.282
You're afraid of looking afraid.

589
00:43:45.316 --> 00:43:48.386
Oh, I am afraid.

590
00:43:49.556 --> 00:43:51.258
No shame in that.

591
00:44:00.330 --> 00:44:04.368
How will they do it? Beheading?

592
00:44:04.402 --> 00:44:06.303
Hanging?

593
00:44:09.674 --> 00:44:11.576
They'll burn you alive.

594
00:44:16.084 --> 00:44:18.114
Bad way to go.

595
00:44:22.018 --> 00:44:23.856
I'll be honest with you.

596
00:44:23.890 --> 00:44:25.856
I don't want to die.

597
00:44:25.890 --> 00:44:27.791
And burnt to death,

598
00:44:27.825 --> 00:44:29.958
I don't want people
to remember me like that,

599
00:44:29.992 --> 00:44:32.662
scorched and screaming.

600
00:44:32.696 --> 00:44:34.695
But it's better than betraying

601
00:44:34.729 --> 00:44:36.262
everything I believe.

602
00:44:36.296 --> 00:44:38.630
And what happens to your people?

603
00:44:38.672 --> 00:44:42.437
You preserve your dignity
and die standing

604
00:44:42.471 --> 00:44:44.971
and they'll sing
songs about you.

605
00:44:45.004 --> 00:44:47.336
You'd rather burn than kneel.

606
00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:49.103
The great hero.

607
00:44:50.777 --> 00:44:53.638
Until winter comes
and the white walkers come for us all

608
00:44:53.672 --> 00:44:56.607
and there's no one left to sing.

609
00:44:58.944 --> 00:45:01.318
You're a good lad.

610
00:45:01.352 --> 00:45:04.254
Truly you are.

611
00:45:04.288 --> 00:45:08.684
But if you can't understand
why I won't enlist my people

612
00:45:08.726 --> 00:45:11.292
in a foreigner's war,

613
00:45:11.327 --> 00:45:13.525
there's no point explaining.

614
00:45:29.811 --> 00:45:31.976
I think you're making
a terrible mistake.

615
00:45:33.673 --> 00:45:36.278
The freedom to make
my own mistakes

616
00:45:36.312 --> 00:45:38.246
was all I ever wanted.

617
00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:51.278
Mance Rayder, you've been called
the King-beyond-the-Wall.

618
00:46:51.312 --> 00:46:54.077
Westeros only has one king.

619
00:46:54.119 --> 00:46:56.581
Bend the knee,
I promise you mercy.

620
00:47:09.965 --> 00:47:12.265
Kneel and live.

621
00:47:19.371 --> 00:47:23.412
This was my home for many years.

622
00:47:25.015 --> 00:47:27.445
I wish you good fortune

623
00:47:27.487 --> 00:47:29.421
in the wars to come.

624
00:48:11.494 --> 00:48:13.492
We all must choose.

625
00:48:13.534 --> 00:48:18.163
Man or woman, young or old,

626
00:48:18.204 --> 00:48:21.499
lord or peasant,
our choices are the same.

627
00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:25.107
We choose light
or we choose darkness.

628
00:48:25.141 --> 00:48:28.139
We choose good
or we choose evil.

629
00:48:28.181 --> 00:48:33.147
We choose the true god
or the false.

630
00:48:43.927 --> 00:48:45.630
Free folk,

631
00:48:45.664 --> 00:48:48.166
there is only one true king

632
00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:51.238
and his name is Stannis.

633
00:48:51.304 --> 00:48:53.638
Here stands your king of lies.

634
00:48:53.672 --> 00:48:56.943
Behold the fate of those
who choose the darkness.
